<HTML><BODY>Besides his monumental 7-volume work, <i>Castes and tribes of southern India</i>, published in Madras, 1909, Edgar Thurston also published <i>Omens and superstitions of southern India</i>. This is a shorter work on folk-believes in Southern India, an interesting collection of curious habits and believes, citing freely from older sources, but at times somewhat condescending.

<p>When typical Indian accented letters appear, you can type them as follows:

<table>
<tr><td>a with macron (bar above)		<td>&#x0101; <td><code>[=a]</code>	<td>(also on a, i, and u, and maybe others.)
<tr><td>s with acute accent above		<td>&#x015B; <td><code>[/s]</code>	<td>
<tr><td>n with dot above				<td>&#x1E45; <td><code>["n]</code>	<td>(note that this is a quote, to distinquish it from the next character; please don't confuse these n with dot above is pronounced ng, n with dot below more like an English n.)
<tr><td>n with dot below				<td>&#x1E47; <td><code>[.n]</code>	<td>(also below t, d, r, l, s, and maybe others.)
</table>


<p>Have fun! (Another volume of <i>Castes and tribes of southern India</i> will follow shortly).
