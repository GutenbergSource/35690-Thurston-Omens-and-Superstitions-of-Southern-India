South Indian manners and customs, surviving, moribund, or deceased.
Among the subjects dealt with are:&mdash;Some marriage customs; death
ceremonies; omens, evil eye, charms, animal superstitions, sorcery,
etc.; votive offerings; deformity and mutilation; torture in by-gone
days, and a few stray survivals; corporal punishment in vernacular
schools; slavery; making fire by friction; fire-walking; hook-swinging;
infanticide; meriah sacrifice; dress; names of natives; the couvade;
earth-eating; boomerang; steelyards, clepsydras, knuckle-dusters,
cock-fighting, tallies, dry-cupping.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This book deals mainly with some aspects of what may
be termed the psychical life of the inhabitants of the Madras
Presidency, and the Native States of Travancore and Cochin. In my
&ldquo;Ethnographic Notes in Southern India&rdquo; (1906), I stated
that the confused chapter devoted to omens, animal superstitions, evil
eye, charms, sorcery, etc., was a mere outline sketch of a group of
subjects, which, if worked up, would furnish material for a volume.
This chapter has now been remodelled, and supplemented by notes
collected since its publication, and information which lies buried in
the seven bulky volumes of my encyclop&aelig;dic &ldquo;Castes and
Tribes of Southern India&rdquo; (1909). The area dealt with (roughly,
182,000 square miles, with a population of 47,800,000) is so vast that
I have had perforce to supplement the personal knowledge acquired in
the course of wandering expeditions in various parts of Southern India,
and in other ways, by recourse to the considerable mass of information,
which is hidden away in official reports, gazetteers, journals of
societies, books, etc.</p>
<p>To the many friends and correspondents, European <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>and Indian,
who have helped me in the accumulation of facts, and those whose
writings I have made liberal use of, I would once more express
collectively, and with all sincerity, my great sense of indebtedness.
My thanks are due to Mr L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer for supplying me
with the illustrations of Malabar yantrams. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In seeking for omens, Natives consult the so-called
science of omens or science of the five birds, and are guided by them.
Selected omens are always included in native calendars or
panch&#257;ngams.</p>
<p>To the quivering and throbbing of various parts of the body as
omens, repeated reference is made in the Hindu classics. Thus, in
Kalid&#257;sa&rsquo;s Sakuntala, King Dushyanta says: &ldquo;This
hermitage is tranquil, and yet my arm throbs. Whence can there be any
result from this in such a place? But yet the gates of destiny are
everywhere.&rdquo; Again, Sakuntala says: &ldquo;Alas! why does my
right eye throb?&rdquo; to which Gautami replies: &ldquo;Child, the
evil be averted. May the tutelary deities of your husband&rsquo;s
family confer happy prospects!&rdquo; In the Raghuvamsa, the statement
occurs that &ldquo;the son of Paulastya, being greatly incensed, drove
an arrow deep into his right arm, which was throbbing, and which,
therefore, prognosticated his union with S&#299;ta.&rdquo; A quivering
sensation in the right arm is supposed to indicate marriage with a
beautiful woman; in the right eye some good luck. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>During a marriage among the Telugu Tottiyans, who have settled in
the Tamil country, a red ram without blemish is sacrificed. It is first
sprinkled with water, and, if it shivers, this is considered a good
omen. It is recorded,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e444src" href=
"#xd26e444" name="xd26e444src">1</a> in connection with the legends of
the Badagas of the N&#299;lgiris, that &ldquo;in the heart of the
Banagudi shola (grove), not far from the Dodd&#363;ru group of
cromlechs, is an odd little shrine to Karair&#257;ya, within which are
a tiny cromlech, some sacred water-worn stones, and sundry little
pottery images representing a tiger, a mounted man, and some dogs.
These keep in memory, it is said, a Badaga who was slain in combat with
a tiger; and annually a festival is held, at which new images are
placed there, and vows are paid. A Kurumba (jungle tribe) makes fire by
friction, and burns incense, throws sanctified water over the numerous
goats brought to be sacrificed, to see if they will shiver in the
manner always held necessary in sacrificed victims, and then slays, one
after the other, those which have shown themselves duly
qualified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In many villages, during the festival to the village deity, water is
poured over a sheep&rsquo;s back, and it is accepted as a good sign if
it shivers. &ldquo;When the people are economical, they keep on pouring
water till it does shiver, to avoid the expense of providing a second
victim for sacrifice. But, where they are more scrupulous, if it does
not shiver, it is taken as a sign that the goddess will not accept it,
and it is taken away.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e449src" href=
"#xd26e449" name="xd26e449src">2</a></p>
<p>Before the thieving Koravas set out on a predatory expedition, a
goat is decorated, and taken to a shrine. It is then placed before the
idol, which is asked whether the expedition will be successful. If the
body of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>animal quivers, it is regarded as an answer in the
affirmative; if it does not, the expedition is abandoned.</p>
<p>If, in addition to quivering, the animal urinates, no better sign
could be looked for. Thieves though they are, the Koravas make it a
point of honour to pay for the goat used in the ceremony. It is said
that, in seeking omens from the quivering of an animal, a very liberal
interpretation is put on the slightest movement. It is recorded by
Bishop Whitehead<a class="noteref" id="xd26e461src" href="#xd26e461"
name="xd26e461src">3</a> that, when an animal has been sacrificed to
the goddess Nukalamma at Coconada, its head is put before the shrine,
and water poured on it. If the mouth opens, it is accepted as a sign
that the sacrifice is accepted.</p>
<p>At the death ceremonies of the Idaiyans of Coimbatore, a cock is
tied to a sacrificial post, to which rice is offered. One end of a
thread is tied to the post, and the other end to a new cloth. The
thread is watched till it shakes, and then broken. The cock is then
killed.</p>
<p>Of omens, both good and bad, in Malabar, the following comprehensive
list is given by Mr Logan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e470src" href=
"#xd26e470" name="xd26e470src">4</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Good.&mdash;Crows, pigeons, etc., and beasts as
deer, etc., moving from left to right, and dogs and jackals moving
inversely, and other beasts found similarly and singly; wild crow,
ruddy goose, mungoose, goat, and peacock seen singly or in couples
either at the right or left. A rainbow seen on the right and left, or
behind, prognosticates good, but the reverse if seen in front.
Buttermilk, raw rice, puttalpira (<i>Trichosanthes anguina</i>,
snake-gourd), priyangu flower, honey, gh&#299; (clarified butter); red
cotton juice, antimony sulphurate, metal mug, bell ringing, lamp,
lotus, karuka grass, raw fish, flesh, flour, ripe fruits, sweetmeats,
gems, sandalwood, elephants, pots filled with water, a virgin, a couple
of Br&#257;hmans, R&#257;jas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>respectable men, white flower, white
yak tail,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e481src" href="#xd26e481" name=

sounds made by birds or beasts, the uplifting of umbrellas, hailing
exclamations, sound of harp, flute, timbrel, tabor, and other
instruments of music, sounds of hymns of consecration and V&#275;dic
recitations, gentle breeze all round at the time of a journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad.&mdash;Men deprived of their limbs, lame or blind, a
corpse or wearer of a cloth put on a corpse, coir (cocoanut fibre),
broken vessels, hearing of words expressive of breaking, burning,
destroying, etc.; the alarming cry of alas! alas! loud screams,
cursing, trembling, sneezing, the sight of a man in sorrow, one with a
stick, a barber, a widow, pepper, and other pungent substances. A
snake, cat, iguana (<i>Varanus</i>), blood-sucker (lizard), or monkey
passing across the road, vociferous beasts such as jackals, dogs, and
kites, loud crying from the east, buffalo, donkey, or temple bull,
black grains, salt, liquor, hide, grass, dirt, faggots, iron, flowers
used for funeral ceremonies, a eunuch, ruffian, outcaste, vomit,
excrement, stench, any horrible figure, bamboo, cotton, lead, cot,
stool or other vehicle carried with legs upward, dishes, cups, etc.,
with mouth downwards, vessels filled with live coals, which are broken
and not burning, broomstick, ashes, winnow, hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the category of good omens among the N&#257;yars of Travancore,
are placed the elephant, a pot full of water, sweetmeats, fruit, fish,
and flesh, images of gods, kings, a cow with its calf, married women,
tied bullocks, gold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>lamps, gh&#299;, and milk. In the list of bad
omens come a donkey, broom, buffalo, untied bullock, barber, widow,
patient, cat, washerman. The worst of all omens is to allow a cat to
cross one&rsquo;s path. An odd number of N&#257;yars, and an even
number of Br&#257;hmans, are good omens, the reverse being particularly
bad. On the Vinayakachaturthi day in the month of Avani, no man is
allowed to look at the rising moon, on penalty of incurring unmerited
obloquy.</p>
<p>By the Pulayas of Travancore, it is considered lucky to see another
Pulaya, a Native Christian, an Izhuva with a vessel in the hand, a cow
behind, or a boat containing sacks of rice. On the other hand, it is
regarded as a very bad omen to be crossed by a cat, to see a fight
between animals, a person with a bundle of clothes, or to meet people
carrying steel instruments.</p>
<p>It is a good omen for the day if, when he gets up in the morning, a
man sees any of the following:&mdash;his wife&rsquo;s face, the lines
on the palm of his right hand, his face in a mirror, the face of a rich
man, the tail of a black cow, the face of a black monkey, or his rice
fields. There is a legend that S&#299;ta used to rise early, and
present herself, bathed and well dressed, before her lord R&#257;ma, so
that he might gaze on her face, and be lucky during the day. This
custom is carried out by all good housewives in Hindu families. A fair
skinned Paraiyan, or a dark skinned Br&#257;hman, should not, in
accordance with a proverb, be seen the first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Hindus are very particular about catching sight of some auspicious
object on the morning of New Year&rsquo;s Day, as the effects of omens
seen on that occasion are believed to last throughout the year. Of the
Vishu festival, held in celebration of the New Year in Malabar, the
following account is given by Mr Gopal Panikkar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e504src" href="#xd26e504" name="xd26e504src">6</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Being the commencement of a new year, native superstition
surrounds it with a peculiarly solemn importance. It is believed that a
man&rsquo;s whole prosperity in life depends upon the nature,
auspicious or otherwise, of the first things that he happens to fix his
eyes upon on this particular morning. According to Nair, and even
general Hindu mythology, there are certain objects which possess an
inherent inauspicious character. For instance, ashes, firewood, oil,
and a lot of similar objects, are inauspicious ones, which will render
him who chances to notice them first fare badly in life for the whole
year, and their obnoxious effects will be removed only on his seeing
holy things, such as reigning princes, oxen, cows, gold, and such like,
on the morning of the next new year. The effects of the sight of these
various materials are said to apply even to the attainment of objects
by a man starting on a special errand, who happens for the first time
to look at them after starting. However, with this view, almost every
family religiously takes care to prepare the most sightworthy objects
on the new year morning. Therefore, on the previous night, they prepare
what is known as a kani. A small circular bell-metal vessel is taken,
and some holy objects are arranged inside it. A grandha or old book
made of palmyra leaves, a gold ornament, a new-washed cloth, some
&lsquo;unprofitably gay&rsquo; flowers of the konna tree (<i>Cassia
Fistula</i>), a measure of rice, a so-called looking-glass made of
bell-metal, and a few other things, are all tastefully arranged in the
vessel, and placed in a prominent room inside the house. On either side
of this vessel, two brass or bell-metal lamps, filled with cocoanut oil
clear as diamond sparks, are kept burning, and a small plank of wood,
or some other seat, is placed in front of it. At about five
o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the day, some one who has got up first
wakes the inmates, both male and female, of the house, and takes them
blindfolded, so that they may not gaze at anything else, to the seat
near the kani. The members are seated, one after another, in the seat,
and are then, and not till then, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>asked to open their eyes, and
carefully look at the kani. Then each is made to look at some venerable
member of the house, or sometimes a stranger even. This over, the
little playful urchins of the house fire small crackers which they have
bought for the occasion. The kani is then taken round the place from
house to house, for the benefit of the poor families, which cannot
afford to prepare such a costly adornment.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>I gather further, in connection with the Vishu festival, that it is
the duty of every devout Hindu to see the village deity the first of
all things in the morning. For this purpose, many sleep within the
temple precincts, and those who sleep in their own houses are escorted
thither by those who have been the first to make their obeisance. Many
go to see the image with their eyes shut, and sometimes bound with a
cloth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e519src" href="#xd26e519" name=
"xd26e519src">7</a></p>
<p>If a person places the head towards the east when sleeping, he will
obtain wealth and health; if towards the south, a lengthening of life;
if towards the west, fame; if towards the north, sickness. The last
position, therefore, should be avoided.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e524src" href="#xd26e524" name="xd26e524src">8</a> In the Telugu
country, when a child is roused from sleep by a thunderclap, the
mother, pressing it to her breast, murmurs, &ldquo;Arjuna
Sah&#257;d&#275;va.&rdquo; The invocation implies the idea that thunder
is caused by the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata heroes, Arjuna and
Sah&#257;d&#275;va.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e527src" href="#xd26e527"
name="xd26e527src">9</a> To dream of a temple car in motion, foretells
the death of a near relative. Night, but not day dreams, are considered
as omens for good or evil. Among those which are auspicious, may be
mentioned riding on a cow, bull, or elephant, entering a temple or
palace, a golden horse, climbing a mountain or tree, drinking liquor,
eating flesh, curds and rice, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>wearing white cloths, or jewelry set
with precious stones, being dressed in white cloths, and embracing a
woman, whose body is smeared with sandal paste. A person will be cured
of sickness if he dreams of Bra&#257;hmans, kings, flowers, jewels,
women, or a looking-glass. Wealth is ensured by a dream that one is
bitten in the shade by a snake, or stung by a scorpion. One who dreams
that he has been bitten by a snake is considered to be proof against
snake-bite; and if he dreams of a cobra, his wife or some near relative
is believed to have conceived. Hindu wives believe that to tell their
husband&rsquo;s name, or pronounce it even in a dream, would bring him
to an untimely end. If a person has an auspicious dream, he should get
up and not go to sleep again. But, if the dream is of evil omen, he
should pray that he may be spared from its ill effects, and may go to
sleep again.</p>
<p>The arrival of a guest is foreshadowed by the hissing noise of the
oven, the slipping of a winnow during winnowing, or of a measure when
measuring rice. If one dines with a friend or relation on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday, it is well; if on a Tuesday,
ill-feeling will ensue; if on a Thursday, endless enmity; if on a
Sunday, hatred. While eating, one should face east, west, south, or
north, according as one wishes for long life, fame, to become
vainglorious, or for justice or truth. Evil is foreshadowed if a light
goes out during meals, or while some auspicious thing, such, for
example, as a marriage, is being discussed. A feast given to the jungle
Paliyans by some missionaries was marred at the outset by the
unfortunate circumstance that betel and tobacco were placed by the side
of the food, these articles being of evil omen as they are placed in
the grave with the dead. Chewing a single areca nut, along with betel
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>leaf secures vigour, two nuts are inauspicious,
three are excellent, and more bring indifferent luck. The basal portion
of the betel leaf must be rejected, as it produces disease; the apical
part, as it induces sin; and the midrib and veins, as they destroy the
intellect. A leaf on which chunam (lime) has been kept, should be
avoided, as it may shorten life.</p>
<p>Before the Koyis shift their quarters, they consult the omens, to
see whether the change will be auspicious or not. Sometimes the
hatching of a clutch of eggs provides the answer, or four grains of
four kinds of seed, representing the prosperity of men, cattle, sheep,
and land, are put on a heap of ashes under a man&rsquo;s bed. Any
movement among them during the night is a bad omen.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e538src" href="#xd26e538" name="xd26e538src">10</a></p>
<p>When a Kondh starts on a shooting expedition, if he first meets an
adult female, married or unmarried, he will return home, and ask a
child to tell the females to keep out of the way. He will then make a
fresh start, and, if he meets a female, will wave his hand to her as a
sign that she must keep clear of him. The Kondh believes that, if he
sees a female, he will not come across animals in the jungle to shoot.
If a woman is in her menses, her husband, brothers, and sons living
under the same roof, will not go out shooting for the same reason.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr F. Fawcett<a class="noteref" id="xd26e545src"
href="#xd26e545" name="xd26e545src">11</a> that it is considered
unlucky by the Koravas, when starting on a dacoity or housebreaking,
&ldquo;to see widows, pots of milk, dogs urinating, a man leading a
bull, or a bull bellowing. On the other hand, it is downright lucky
when a bull bellows at the scene of the criminal operation. To see a
man goading a bull is a good omen when starting, and a bad one at the
scene. The eighteenth day of the Tamil month, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>Avani,
is the luckiest day of all for committing crimes. A successful criminal
exploit on this day ensures good luck throughout the year. Sundays,
which are auspicious for weddings, are inauspicious for crimes.
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are unlucky until noon for starting
out from home. So, too, is the day after new moon.&rdquo; Fridays are
unsuitable for breaking into the houses of Br&#257;hmans or
K&#333;matis, as they may be engaged in worshipping Ankalamma, to whom
the day is sacred.</p>
<p>Some B&#333;yas in the Bellary district enjoy in&#257;m (rent free)
lands, in return for propitiating the village goddesses by a rite
called bh&#363;ta bali, which is intended to secure the prosperity of
the village. The B&#333;ya priest gets himself shaved at about
midnight, sacrifices a sheep or buffalo, mixes its blood with rice, and
distributes the rice thus prepared in small balls throughout the
village. When he starts on this business, all the villagers bolt their
doors, as it is not considered auspicious to see him then.</p>
<p>When a student starts for the examination hall, he will, if he sees
a widow or a Br&#257;hman, retrace his steps, and start again after the
lapse of a few minutes. Meeting two Br&#257;hmans would indicate good
luck, and he would proceed on his way full of hope.</p>
<p>If, when a person is leaving his house, the head or feet strike
accidentally against the threshold, he should not go out, as it
forebodes some impending mischief. Sometimes, when a person returns
home from a distance, especially at night, he is kept standing at the
door, and, after he has washed his hands and feet, an elderly female or
servant of the house brings a shallow plate full of water mixed with
lime juice and chunam (lime), with some chillies and pieces of charcoal
floating on it. The plate is carried three times round the person, and
the contents are then thrown into the street without being seen by the
man. He then enters the house. If a person knocks at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>the door
of a house in the night once, twice, or thrice, it will not be opened.
If the knock is repeated a fourth time, the door will be opened without
fear, for the evil spirit is said to knock only thrice.</p>
<p>A tickling sensation in the sole of the right foot foretells that
the person has to go on a journey. The omens are favourable if any of
the following are met with by one who is starting on a journey, or
special errand:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sometimes people leave their house, and sleep elsewhere on the night
preceding an inauspicious day, on which a journey is to be made.
Unlucky days for starting on a journey are v&#257;ra-s&#363;lai, or
days on which Siva&rsquo;s trident (s&#363;la) is kept on the ground.
The direction in which it lies, varies according to the day of the
week. For example, Sunday before noon is a bad time to start towards
the west, as the trident is turned that way. It is said to be unlucky
to go westward on Friday or Sunday, eastward on Monday or Saturday,
north on Tuesday or Wednesday, south on Thursday. A journey begun on
Tuesday is liable to result in loss by thieves or fire at home. Loss,
too, is likely to follow a journey begun on Saturday, and sickness a
start on Sunday. Wednesday and Friday are both propitious days, and a
journey begun on either with a view to business will be lucrative. The
worst days for travelling are Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday.<a class=

On more than one occasion, a subordinate in my office overstayed his
leave on the ground that his guru (spiritual preceptor) told him that
the day on which he should have returned was an unlucky one for a
journey.</p>
<p>If a traveller sees a hare on his way, he may be sure that he will
not succeed in the object of his journey. If, however, the hare touches
him, and he does not at once turn back and go home, he is certain to
meet with a great misfortune. There is an authority for this
superstition in the R&#257;mayana. After R&#257;ma had recovered
S&#299;ta and returned to Ayodha, he was informed that, whilst a
washerman and his wife were quarrelling, the former had exclaimed that
he was not such a fool as the king had been to take back his wife after
she had been carried away by a stranger. R&#257;ma thought this over,
and resolved to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>send his wife into the forest. His brother,
Lutchmana, was to drive her there, and then to leave her alone. On
their way they met a hare, and S&#299;ta, who was ignorant of the
purpose of the journey, begged Lutchmana to return, as the omen was a
bad one.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e704src" href="#xd26e704" name=

<p>If a dog scratches its body, a traveller will fall ill; if it lies
down and wags its tail, some disaster will follow. To one proceeding on
a journey, a dog crossing the path from right to left is auspicious.
But, if it gets on his person or his feet, shaking its ears, the
journey will be unlucky.</p>
<p>A person should postpone an errand on which he is starting, if he
sees a cobra or rat-snake. In a recent judicial case, a witness gave
evidence to the effect that he was starting on a journey, and when he
had proceeded a short way, a snake crossed the road. This being an evil
omen, he went back and put off his journey till the following day. On
his way he passed through a village in which some men had been arrested
for murder, and found that one of two men, whom he had promised to
accompany and had gone on without him, had been murdered.</p>
<p>Sneezing once is a good sign; twice, a bad sign. When a child
sneezes, those near it usually say &ldquo;dirg&#257;yus&rdquo; (long
life), or &ldquo;sath&#257;yus&rdquo; (a hundred years). The rishi or
sage Markand&#275;ya, who was remarkable for his austerities and great
age, is also known as Dirg&#257;yus. Adults who sneeze pronounce the
name of some god, the common expression being
&ldquo;Srimadrangam.&rdquo; When a Badaga baby is born, it is a good
omen if the father sneezes before the umbilical cord has been cut, and
an evil one if he sneezes after its severance. In the Teluga country it
is believed that a child who sneezes on a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>winnowing fan, or on the
door-frame, will meet with misfortune unless balls of boiled rice are
thrown over it; and a man who sneezes during his meal, especially at
night, will also be unlucky unless water is sprinkled over his face,
and he is made to pronounce his own name, and that of his birthplace
and his patron deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e715src" href=

<p>Gaping is an indication that evil spirits have effected an entrance
into the body. Hence many Br&#257;hmans, when they gape, snap their
fingers as a preventive.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e720src" href=
"#xd26e720" name="xd26e720src">15</a> When a great man yawns, his sleep
is promoted by all the company with him snapping their fingers with

Alberuni<a class="noteref" id="xd26e723src" href="#xd26e723" name=
"xd26e723src">16</a> that Hindus &ldquo;spit out and blow their noses
without any respect for the elder ones present, and crack their lice
before them. They consider the <i>crepitus ventris</i> as a good omen,
sneezing as a bad omen.&rdquo; In Travancore, a courtier must cover the
mouth with the right hand, lest his breath should pollute the king or
other superior. Also, at the temples, a low-caste man must wear a
bandage over his nose and mouth, so that his breath may not pollute the
idols.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e729src" href="#xd26e729" name=
"xd26e729src">17</a> A Kudumi woman in Travancore, at the menstrual
period, should stand at a distance of seven feet, closing her mouth and

<p>A Kumb&#257;ra potter, when engaged in the manufacture of the pot or
household deity for the Kurubas, should cover his mouth with a bandage,
so that his breath may not defile it. The Koragas of South Canara are
said to be regarded with such intense loathing that, up to quite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>recent times, one section of them called Ande or
pot Kurubas, continually wore a pot suspended from their necks, into
which they were compelled to spit, being so utterly unclean as to be
prohibited from even spitting on the highway.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e737src" href="#xd26e737" name="xd26e737src">18</a> In a note on

their lips, and their fingers to their mouths, in such a way that they
are defiled with the spittle. A Br&#257;hman may take snuff, but he
should not smoke a cheroot or cigar. When once the cheroot has touched
his lips, it is defiled by the saliva, and, therefore, cannot be
returned to his mouth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e746src" href=

<p>At the festivals of the village deities in the Telugu country, an
unmarried M&#257;diga (Telugu Pariah) woman, called
M&#257;tangi<a class="noteref" id="xd26e751src" href="#xd26e751" name=
"xd26e751src">21</a> (the name of a favourite goddess) spits upon the
people assembled, and touches them with her stick. Her touch and saliva
are believed to purge all uncleanliness of body and soul, and are said
to be invited by men who would ordinarily scorn to approach her. At a
festival called Kathiru in honour of a village goddess in the Cochin
State, the Pulayans (agrestic slaves) go in procession to the temple,
and scatter packets of palm-leaves containing handfuls of paddy
(unhusked rice) rolled up in straw among the crowds of spectators along
the route. &ldquo;The spectators, both young and old, scramble to
obtain as many of the packets as possible, and carry them home. They
are then hung in front of the houses, for it is believed that their
presence will help to promote the prosperity of the family, until the
festival comes round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"
name="pb28">28</a>]</span>again next year. The greater the number of
trophies obtained for a family by its members, the greater, it is
believed, will be the prosperity of the family.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>In a note on the Kulw&#257;dis or Chalav&#257;dis of the Hassan
district in Mysore, Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie writes<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e763src" href="#xd26e763" name="xd26e763src">23</a> as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Every village has its Holigiri&mdash;as the
quarters inhabited by the Holiars (formerly agrestic serfs) is
called&mdash;outside the village boundary hedge. This, I thought, was
because they are considered an impure race, whose touch carries
defilement with it. Such is the reason generally given by the
Br&#257;hman, who refuses to receive anything directly from the hands
of a Holiar, and yet the Br&#257;hmans consider great luck will wait
upon them if they can manage to pass through the Holigiri without being
molested. To this the Holiars have a strong objection, and, should a
Br&#257;hman attempt to enter their quarters, they turn out in a body
and slipper him, in former times it is said to death. Members of the
other castes may come as far as the door, but they must not enter the
house, for that would bring the Holiar bad luck. If, by chance, a
person happens to get in, the owner takes care to tear the
intruder&rsquo;s cloth, tie up some salt in one corner of it, and turn
him out. This is supposed to neutralise all the good luck which might
have accrued to the trespasser, and avert any evil which might have
befallen the owner of the house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Telugu Tottiyans, who have settled in the Tamil country, are
said by Mr F. R. Hemingway not to recognise the superiority of
Br&#257;hmans. They are supposed to possess unholy powers, especially
the Nalla (black) Gollas, and are much dreaded by their neighbours.
They do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>not allow any stranger to enter their villages
with shoes on, or on horseback, or holding up an umbrella, lest their
god should be offended. It is believed that, if any one breaks this
rule, he will be visited with illness or some other punishment.</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr S. P. Rice that, when smallpox breaks out in a
Hindu house, it is a popular belief that to allow strangers or unclean
persons to go into the house, to observe festivals, and even to permit
persons who have combed their hair, bathed in oil, or had a shave, to
see the patient, would arouse the anger of the goddess, and bring
certain death to the sick person. Strangers, and young married women
are not admitted to, and may not approach the house, as they may have
had sexual intercourse on the previous day.</p>
<p>It is believed that the sight or breath of Muhammadans, just after
they have said their prayers at a mosque, will do good to children
suffering from various disorders. For this purpose, women carry or take
their children, and post themselves at the entrance to a mosque at the
time when worshippers leave it. Most of them are Hindus, but sometimes
poor Eurasians may be seen there. I once received a pathetic appeal
from a Eurasian woman in Malabar, imploring me to lay my hands on the
head of her sick child, so that its life might be spared.</p>
<p>In teaching the Gr&#257;ndha alphabet to children, they are made to
repeat the letter &ldquo;ca&rdquo; twice quickly without pausing, as
the word &ldquo;ca&rdquo; means &ldquo;die.&rdquo; In Malabar, the
instruction of a Tiyan child in the alphabet is said by Mr F. Fawcett
to begin on the last day of the Dasara festival in the fifth year of
its life. A teacher, who has been selected with care, or a lucky
person, holds the child&rsquo;s right hand, and makes it trace the
letters of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>Malay&#257;lam alphabet in rice spread on a plate.
The forefinger, which is the one used in offering water to the souls of
the dead, and in other parts of the death ceremonies, must not be used
for tracing the letters, but is placed above the middle finger, merely
to steady it. For the same reason, a doctor, when making a pill, will
not use the forefinger. To mention the number seven in Telugu is
unlucky, because the word (y&#275;du) is the same as that for weeping.
Even a treasury officer, who is an enlightened university graduate, in
counting money, will say six and one. The number seven is, for the same
reason, considered unlucky by the Koravas, and a house-breaking
expedition should not consist of seven men. Should this, however, be
unavoidable, a fiction is indulged in of making the house-breaking
implement the eighth member of the gang.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e782src" href="#xd26e782" name="xd26e782src">24</a> In Tamil the
word ten is considered inauspicious, because, on the tenth day after
the death of her husband, a widow removes the emblems of married life.
Probably for this reason, the offspring of Kallan polyandrous marriages
style themselves the children of eight and two, not ten fathers.
L&#257;bha is a Sanskrit word meaning profit or gain, and has its
equivalent in all the vernacular languages. Hindus, when counting,
commence with this word instead of the word signifying one. In like
manner, Muhammadans use the word Bismillah or Burketh, apparently as an
invocation like the medicinal &#8478; (Oh! Jupiter, aid us). When the
number a hundred has been counted, they again begin with the substitute
for one, and this serves as a one for the person who is keeping the
tally. Oriya merchants say labho (gain) instead of eko (one), when
counting out the seers of rice for the elephants&rsquo; rations. The
people of the Oriya Zemindaris often use, not the year of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>Hindu cycle or Muhammadan era, but the year of the
reigning R&#257;ja of Puri. The first year of the reign is called, not
one, but labho. The counting then proceeds in the ordinary course, but,
with the exception of the number ten, all numbers ending with seven or
nothing are omitted. This is called the onko. Thus, if a R&#257;ja has
reigned two and a half years, he would be said to be in the
twenty-fifth onko, seven, seventeen and twenty being omitted.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e787src" href="#xd26e787" name="xd26e787src">25</a>
For chewing betel, two other ingredients are necessary, viz., areca
nuts and chunam (lime). For some reason, Tamil Vaishnavas object to
mentioning the last by name, and call it moonavadu, or the third.</p>
<p>At a Br&#257;hman funeral, the sons and nephews of the deceased go
round the corpse, and untie their kudumi (hair knot), leaving part
thereof loose, tie up the rest into a small bunch, and slap their
thighs. Consequently, when children at play have their kudumi partially
tied, and slap their thighs, they are invariably scolded owing to the
association with funerals. Among all Hindu classes it is considered as
an insult to the god to bathe or wash the feet on returning home from
worship at a temple, and, by so doing, the punyam (good) would be lost.
Moreover, washing the feet at the entrance to a home is connected with
funerals, inasmuch as, on the return from the burning-ground, a mourner
may not enter the house until he has washed his feet. The Badagas of
the N&#299;lgiris hold an agricultural festival called devv&#275;,
which should on no account be pronounced duvv&#275;, which means
burning-ground.</p>
<p>A bazaar shop-keeper who deals in colours will not sell white paint
after the lamps have been lighted. In like manner, a cloth-dealer
refuses to sell black cloth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>and the dealer in hardware to sell
nails, needles, etc., lest poverty should ensue. Digging operations
with a spade should be stopped before the lamps are lighted. A
betel-vine cultivator objects to entering his garden or plucking a leaf
after the lighting of the lamps; but, if some leaves are urgently
required, he will, before plucking them, pour water from a pot at the
foot of the tree on which the vine is growing.</p>
<p>Arrack (liquor) vendors consider it unlucky to set their measures
upside down. Some time ago, the Excise Commissioner informs me, the
Madras Excise Department had some aluminium measures made for measuring
arrack in liquor shops. It was found that the arrack corroded the
aluminium, and the measures soon leaked. The shop-keepers were told to
turn their measures upside down, in order that they might drain. This
they refused to do, as it would bring bad luck to their shops. New
measures with round bottoms, which would not stand up, were evolved.
But the shop-keepers began to use rings of indiarubber from soda-water
bottles, to make them stand. An endeavour was then made to induce them
to keep their measures inverted by hanging them on pegs, so that they
would drain without being turned upside down. The case illustrates how
important a knowledge of the superstitions of the people is in the
administration of their affairs. Even so trifling an innovation as the
introduction of a new arrangement for maintaining tension in the warp
during the process of weaving gave rise a few years ago to a strike
among the hand-loom weavers at the Madras School of Arts.</p>
<p>When a Paidi (agriculturists and weavers in Ganjam) is seriously
ill, a male or female sorcerer (bejjo or bejjano) is consulted. A
square divided into sixteen compartments is drawn on the floor with
rice flour. In each compartment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>are placed a leaf-cup of
<i>Butea frondosa</i>, a quarter-anna piece, and some food. Seven small
bows and arrows are set up in front thereof in two lines. On one side
of the square, a big cup filled with food is placed. A fowl is
sacrificed, and its blood poured thrice round this cup. Then, placing
water in a vessel near the cup, the sorcerer or sorceress throws into
it a grain of rice, giving out at the same time the name of some god or
goddess. If the rice sinks, it is believed that the illness is caused
by the anger of the deity, whose name has been mentioned. If the rice
floats, the names of various deities are called out, until a grain
sinks. When selecting a site for a new dwelling hut, the M&#257;liah
Savaras place on the proposed site as many grains of rice in pairs as
there are married members in the family, and cover them over with a
cocoanut shell. They are examined on the following day, and, if they
are all there, the site is considered auspicious. Among the K&#257;pu
Savaras, the grains of rice are folded up in leaflets of the bael tree
(<i>&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>), and placed in a split bamboo.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Gloyer<a class="noteref" id="xd26e811src" href=
"#xd26e811" name="xd26e811src">26</a> that &ldquo;when a D&#333;mb
(Vizagapatam hill tribe) house has to be built, the first thing is to
select a favourable spot, to which few evil spirits (d&#363;mas)
resort. At this spot they put, in several places, three grains of rice
arranged in such a way that the two lower grains support the upper one.
To protect the grains, they pile up stones round them, and the whole is
lightly covered with earth. When, after some time, they find on
inspection that the upper grain has fallen off, the spot is regarded as
unlucky, and must not be used. If the position of the grains remains
unchanged, the omen is regarded as auspicious. They drive in the first
post, which must have a certain length, say of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>five,
seven, or nine ells, the ell being measured from the tip of the middle
finger to the elbow. The post is covered on the top with rice straw,
leaves, and shrubs, so that birds may not foul it, which would be an
evil omen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Madras, a story is current with reference to the statue of Sir
Thomas Munro, that he seized upon all the rice dep&ocirc;ts, and
starved the people by selling rice in egg-shells, at one shell for a
rupee. To punish him, the Government erected the statue in an open
place without a canopy, so that the birds of the air might insult him
by polluting his face. In the Bellary district, the names Munrol and
Munrolappa are common, and are given in hope that the boy may attain
the same celebrity as the former Governor of Madras. (I once came
across a Telugu cultivator, who rejoiced in the name of Curzon). One of
Sir Thomas Munro&rsquo;s good qualities was that, like R&#257;ma and
Rob Roy, his arms reached to his knees, or, in other words, he
possessed the quality of an Ajanubahu, which is the heritage of kings,
or those who have blue blood in them.</p>
<p>In a case of dispute between two Koravas,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e820src" href="#xd26e820" name="xd26e820src">27</a> &ldquo;the
decision is sometimes arrived at by means of an ordeal. An equal
quantity of rice is placed in two pots of equal weight, having the same
quantity of water, and there is an equal quantity of fire-wood. The
judges satisfy themselves most carefully as to quantity, weights, and
so on. The water is boiled, and the man whose rice boils first is
declared to be the winner of the dispute. The loser has to recoup the
winner all his expenses. It sometimes happens that both pots boil at
the same time; then a coin is to be picked out of a pot containing
boiling oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one of the religious ceremonies of the Koravas, offerings of
boiled rice (pongal) are made to the deity, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>Pol&#275;ramma, by fasting women. The manner in
which the boiling food bubbles over from the cooking-pot is eagerly
watched, and accepted as an omen for good or evil. A festival called
Pongal is observed by Hindus on the first day of the Tamil month Tai,
and derives its name from the fact that rice boiled in milk is offered
to propitiate the Sun God.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony of walking through fire<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e829src" href="#xd26e829" name="xd26e829src">28</a> (burning
embers) at Nidugala on the N&#299;lgiris, the omens are taken by
boiling two pots of milk, side by side, on two hearths. If the milk
overflows uniformly on all sides, the crops will be abundant for all
the villages. But, if it flows over on one side only, there will be
plentiful crops for villages on that side only. For boiling the milk, a
light obtained by friction must be used. After the milk-boiling
ceremonial, the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest), tying bells on his legs,
approaches the fire-pit, carrying milk freshly drawn from a cow, which
has calved for the first time, and flowers of <i>Rhododendron</i>,
<i>Leucas</i>, or jasmine. After doing p&#363;ja (worship), he throws
the flowers on the embers, and they should remain unscorched for a few
seconds. He then pours some of the milk over the embers, and no hissing
sound should be produced. The omens being propitious, he walks over the
glowing embers, followed by a Udaya<a class="noteref" id="xd26e841src"
href="#xd26e841" name="xd26e841src">29</a> and the crowd of celebrants,
who, before going through the ordeal, count the hairs on their feet. If
any are singed, it is a sign of approaching ill-fortune, or even
death.</p>
<p>It is recorded by the Rev. J. Cain<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e846src" href="#xd26e846" name="xd26e846src">30</a> that, when the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>Koyis of the Goda&#257;vari district determine to
appease the goddess of smallpox or cholera, they erect a pandal (booth)
outside their village under a n&#299;m tree (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>).
They make the image of a woman with earth from a white-ant hill, tie a
cloth or two round it, hang a few peacock&rsquo;s feathers round its
neck, and place it under the pandal on a three-legged stool made from
the wood of the silk-cotton tree (<i>Cochlospermum Gossypium</i>). They
then bring forward a chicken, and try to persuade it to eat some of the
grains which they have thrown before the image, requesting the goddess
to inform them whether she will leave their village or not. If the
chicken picks up some of the grains, they regard it as a most
favourable omen; but, if not, their hearts are filled with dread of the
continued anger of the goddess. At the Bh&#363;d&#275;vi Panduga, or
festival of the earth goddess, according to Mr F. R. Hemingway, the
Koyis set up a stone beneath a <i>Terminalia tomentosa</i> tree, which
is thus dedicated to the goddess Kodalamma. Each worshipper brings a
cock to the priest, who holds it over grains of rice, which have been
sprinkled before the goddess. If the bird pecks at the rice, good luck
is ensured for the coming year, whilst, if perchance the bird pecks
three times, the offerer of that particular bird can scarcely contain
himself for joy. If the bird declines to touch the grains, ill-luck is
sure to visit the owner&rsquo;s house during the ensuing year.</p>
<p>Concerning a boundary oath in the Mulkangiri t&#257;luk of
Vizagapatam, Mr C. A. Henderson writes to me as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) levelled a piece
of ground about a foot square, and smeared it with cow-dung. The

heap. The p&#363;j&#257;ri touched the rice-flour <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>line
with the tips of his fingers, and then pressed his knuckles on the same
place, thus leaving an exit on the south side. He then held a chicken
over the central heap, and muttered some mantrams. The chicken pecked
at the rice, and an egg was placed on the heap. The chicken then pecked
at the rice again. The ceremony then waited for another party, who
performed a similar ceremony. There was some amusement because their
chickens would not eat. The chickens were decapitated, and their heads
placed in the square. The eggs were then broken. It was raining, and
there was a resulting puddle of cow-dung, chicken&rsquo;s blood, egg,
and rice, of which the representatives of each party took a portion,
and eat it, or pretended to do so, stating to whom the land belonged.
There is said to be a belief that, if a man swears falsely, he will
die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though not bearing on the subject of omens, some further boundary
ceremonies may be placed under reference. At S&#257;ttamangalam, in the
South Arcot district, the festival of the goddess M&#257;riamma is said
to be crowned by the sacrifice at midnight of a goat, the entrails of
which are hung round the neck of the Toti (scavenger), who then goes,
stark naked, save for this one adornment, round all the village
boundaries.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e876src" href="#xd26e876" name=
"xd26e876src">31</a></p>
<p>It is recorded by Bishop Whitehead<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e881src" href="#xd26e881" name="xd26e881src">32</a> that, in some
parts of the Tamil country, <i>e.g.</i>, in the Trichinopoly district,
at the ceremony for the propitiation of the village boundary goddess, a
priest carries a pot containing boiled rice and the blood of a lamb
which has been sacrificed to the boundary stone, round which he runs
three times. The third time he throws the pot over his shoulder on to
another smaller stone, which stands at the foot of the boundary stone.
The pot is dashed to pieces, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>the rice and blood scatter over
the two stones and all round them. The priest then goes away without
looking back, followed by the crowd of villagers in dead silence. In
the Cuddapah district, when there is a boundary dispute in a village,
an image of the goddess Gangamma is placed in the street, and left
there for two days. The head of a buffalo and several sheep are offered
to her, and the blood is allowed to run into the gutter. The goddess is
then worshipped, and she is implored to point out the correct
boundary.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e891src" href="#xd26e891" name=
"xd26e891src">33</a> In Mysore, if there is a dispute as to the village
boundaries, the Holeya<a class="noteref" id="xd26e894src" href=
"#xd26e894" name="xd26e894src">34</a> Kuluv&#257;di is believed to be
the only person competent to take the oath as to how the boundary ought
to run. The old custom for settling such disputes is thus described by
Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e898src" href=
"#xd26e898" name="xd26e898src">35</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Kuluv&#257;di, carrying on his head a ball
made of the village earth, in the centre of which is placed some earth,
passes along the boundary. If he has kept the proper line, everything
goes well, but, should he, by accident even, go beyond his own proper
boundary, then the ball of earth, of its own accord, goes to pieces.
The Kuluv&#257;di is said to die within fifteen days, and his house
becomes a ruin. Such is the popular belief.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some years ago Mr H. D. Taylor was called on to settle a boundary
dispute between two villages in Jeypore under the following
circumstances. As the result of a panch&#257;yat (council meeting), the
men of one village had agreed to accept the boundary claimed by the
other party if the head of their village walked round the boundary and
eat earth at intervals, provided that no harm came to him within six
months. The man accordingly perambulated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>the boundary eating
earth, and a conditional order of possession was given. Shortly
afterwards the man&rsquo;s cattle died, one of his children died of
smallpox, and finally he himself died within three months. The other
party then claimed the land on the ground that the earth-goddess had
proved him to have perjured himself. It was urged in defence that the
man had been made to eat earth at such frequent intervals that he
contracted dysentery, and died from the effects of
earth-eating.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e909src" href="#xd26e909" name=

<p>When the time for the annual festival of the tribal goddess of the
Kuruvikk&#257;rans (Mar&#257;thi-speaking beggars) draws nigh, the
headman or an elder piles up <i>Vigna Catiang</i> seeds in five small
heaps. He then decides in his mind whether there is an odd or even
number of seeds in the majority of heaps. If, when the seeds are
counted, the result agrees with his forecast, it is taken as a sign of
the approval of the goddess, and arrangements for the festival are
made. Otherwise it is abandoned for the year.</p>
<p>At the annual festival of Chaud&#275;swari, the tribal goddess of
D&#275;v&#257;nga weavers, the priest tries to balance a long sword on
its point on the edge of the mouth of a pot. A lime fruit is placed in
the region of the navel of the idol, who should throw it down
spontaneously. A bundle of betel leaves is cut across with a knife, and
the cut ends should unite. If the omens are favourable, a lamp made of
rice-flour is lighted, and pongal (boiled rice) offered to it.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Canter Visscher<a class="noteref" id="xd26e925src"
href="#xd26e925" name="xd26e925src">37</a> that, in the building of a
house in Malabar, the carpenters open three or four cocoanuts, spilling
the juice as little as possible, and put some tips of betel leaves into
them. From the way these float on the liquid they foretell whether the
house will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>be lucky or unlucky, whether it will stand for a
long or short period, and whether another will ever be erected on its
site.</p>
<p>Korava women, if their husbands are absent on a criminal expedition
long enough to arouse apprehension of danger, pull a long piece out of
a broom, and tie to one end of it several small pieces dipped in oil.
If the stick floats in water, all is well; but, should it sink, two of
the women start at once to find the men.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In the village of Chakibunda in the Cuddapah district, there is a
pool of water at the foot of a hill. Those who are desirous of getting
children, wealth, etc., go there and pour oil into the water. The oil
is said not to float as is usual in greasy bubbles, but to sink and
never rise. They also offer betel leaves, on which turmeric and
kunkumam have been placed. If these leaves sink, and after some time
reappear without the turmeric and kunkumam, but with the marks of nails
upon them, the person offering them will gain his wishes. The contents
of the leaves, and the oil, are supposed to be consumed by some divine
being at the bottom of the pool.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e937src"
href="#xd26e937" name="xd26e937src">39</a> At Madicheruvu, in the
Cuddapah district, there is a small waterfall in the midst of a jungle,
which is visited annually by a large number of pilgrims. Those who are
anxious to know if their sins are forgiven stand under the fall. If
they are acceptable the water falls on their heads, but, if they have
some great guilt weighing on them, the water swerves on one side, and
refuses to be polluted by contact with the sinner.<a class="noteref"

<p>Among the V&#257;das (Telugu fishermen) the Mann&#257;ru is an
important individual who not only performs worship, but is consulted on
many points. If a man does not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>secure good catches of fish, he
goes to the Mann&#257;ru to ascertain the cause of his bad luck. The
Mann&#257;ru holds in his hand a string on which a stone is tied, and
invokes various gods and goddesses by name. Every time a name is
mentioned, the stone either swings to and fro like a pendulum, or
performs a circular movement. If the former occurs, it is a sign that
the deity whose name has been pronounced is the cause of the
misfortune, and must be propitiated in a suitable manner.</p>
<p>The Nomad Bauris or B&#257;wariyas, who commit robberies and
manufacture counterfeit coin, keep with them a small quantity of wheat
and sandal seeds in a tin or brass case, which they call
d&#275;vakadana or god&rsquo;s grain, and a tuft of peacock&rsquo;s
feathers. They are very superstitious, and do not embark on any
enterprise without first ascertaining by omens whether it will be
attended with success or not. This they do by taking at random a small
quantity of grains out of the d&#275;vakadana, and counting the number
thereof, the omen being considered good or bad according as the number
is odd or even.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e951src" href="#xd26e951"
name="xd26e951src">41</a> A gang of Donga D&#257;saris, before starting
on a thieving expedition, proceed to the jungle near their village in
the early part of the night, worship their favourite goddesses,
Huligavva and Ellamma, and sacrifice a sheep or fowl before them. They
place one of their turbans on the head of the animal as soon as its
head falls on the ground. If the turban turns to the right it is
considered a good sign, the goddess having permitted them to proceed on
the expedition; if to the left they return home. Hanum&#257;n (the
monkey god) is also consulted as to such expeditions. They go to a
Hanum&#257;n temple, and, after worshipping him, garland him with a
wreath of flowers. The garland hangs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>on both sides of the
neck. If any of the flowers on the right side drop down first, it is
regarded as a permission granted by the god to start on a plundering
expedition; and, conversely, an expedition is never undertaken if any
flower happens to drop from the left side first.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e956src" href="#xd26e956" name="xd26e956src">42</a> The Kallans
are said by Mr F. S. Mullaly<a class="noteref" id="xd26e962src" href=
"#xd26e962" name="xd26e962src">43</a> to consult the deity before
starting on depredations. Two flowers, the one red and the other white,
are placed before the idol, a symbol of their god Kalla Alagar. The
white flower is the emblem of success. A child of tender years is told
to pluck a petal of one of the two flowers, and the success of the
undertaking rests upon the choice made by the child. The Pulluvan
astrologers of Malabar sometimes calculate beforehand the result of a
project in which they are engaged, by placing before the god two
bouquets of flowers, one red, the other white, of which a child picks
out one with its eyes closed. Selection of the white bouquet predicts
auspicious results, of the red the reverse. In the same way, when the
Kamm&#257;lans (Tamil artisans) appoint their Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran to preside over them, five men selected
from each of the five divisions meet at the temple of the caste
goddess, K&#257;m&#257;kshi Amman. The names of the five men are
written on five slips of paper, which, together with some blank slips,
are thrown before the shrine of the goddess. A child, taken at random
from the assembled crowd, is made to pick up the slips, and he whose
name turns up first is proclaimed Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran.</p>
<p>Eclipses are regarded as precursors of evil, which must, if
possible, be averted. Concerning the origin thereof, according to
tradition in Malabar, Mr Gopal Panikkar writes as follows<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e967src" href="#xd26e967" name=
"xd26e967src">44</a>:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Tradition says that, when an eclipse takes
place, R&#257;hu the huge serpent is devouring the sun or moon, as the
case may be. An eclipse being thus the decease of one of those heavenly
bodies, people must, of necessity, observe pollution for the period
during which the eclipse lasts. When the monster spits out the body,
the eclipse is over. Food and drink taken during an eclipse possess
poisonous properties, and people therefore abstain from eating and
drinking until the eclipse is over. They bathe at the end of the
eclipse, so as to get rid of the pollution. Any one shutting himself up
from exposure may be exempted from this obligation to take a
bath.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deaths from drowning are not unknown in Madras at times of eclipse,
when Hindus bathe in the sea, and get washed away by the surf. It is
said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e977src" href="#xd26e977" name=
"xd26e977src">45</a> that, before an eclipse, the people prepare their
drums, etc., to frighten the giant, lest he should eat up the moon
entirely. Images of snakes are offered to the deity on days of eclipse
by Br&#257;hmans on whose star day the eclipse falls, to appease the
wrath of the terrible R&#257;hu. It is noted by Mr S. M. Natesa
Sastri<a class="noteref" id="xd26e980src" href="#xd26e980" name=
"xd26e980src">46</a> that &ldquo;the eclipse must take place on some
asterism or other, and, if that asterism happens to be that in which
any Hindu was born, he has to perform some special ceremonies to
absolve himself from impending evil. He makes a plate of gold or
silver, or of palm leaf, according to his means, and ties it on his
forehead with Sanskrit verses inscribed on it. He sits with this plate
for some time, performs certain ceremonies, bathes with the plate
untied, and presents it to a Br&#257;hman with some fee, ranging from
four annas to several thousands of rupees. The belief that an eclipse
is a calamity to the sun or moon is such a strong Hindu belief, that no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>marriage takes place in the month in which an
eclipse falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gather<a class="noteref" id="xd26e987src" href="#xd26e987" name=
"xd26e987src">47</a> that, &ldquo;during an eclipse, many of the people
retire into their houses, and remain behind closed doors until the evil
hour has passed. The time is in all respects inauspicious, and no work
begun or completed during this period can meet with success; indeed, so
great is the dread, that no one would think of initiating any important
work at this time. More especially is it fatal to women who are
pregnant, for the evil will fall upon the unborn babe, and, in cases of
serious malformation or congenital lameness, the cause is said to be
that the mother looked on an eclipse. Women, therefore, not only retire
into the house, but, in order that they may be further protected from
the evil, they burn horn shavings. The evils of an eclipse are not
limited to human beings, but cattle and crops also need protection from
the malignant spirits which are supposed to be abroad. In order that
the cattle may be preserved, they are as far as possible taken indoors,
and especially those which have young calves; and, to make assurance
doubly sure, their horns are smeared with chunam (lime). The crops are
protected by procuring ashes from the potter&rsquo;s field, which seem
to be specially potent against evil spirits. With these ashes images
are made, and placed on the four sides of the field. Comets, too, are
looked upon as omens of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person is about to occupy a new house, he takes particular
care to see that the planet Venus does not face him as he enters it.
With this star before him, he sometimes postpones the occupation, or,
if he is obliged to enter, he reluctantly does so through the
back-door.</p>
<p>On the day of the capture of Seringaptam, which, being the last day
of a lunar month, was inauspicious, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>the astrologer repeated the
unfavourable omen to T&#299;pu Sult&#257;n, who was slain in the course
of the battle. It is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd26e998src" href=
"#xd26e998" name="xd26e998src">48</a> that &ldquo;to different Bramins
he gave a black buffalo, a milch buffalo, a male buffalo, a black
she-goat, a jacket of coarse black cloth, a cap of the same material,
ninety rupees, and an iron pot filled with oil; and, previous to the
delivery of this last article, he held his head over the pot for the
purpose of seeing the image of his face; a ceremony used in Hindostan
to avert misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time at which the address of welcome by the Madras Municipal
Corporation to Sir Arthur Lawley on his taking over the Governorship of
Madras was changed from 12&ndash;30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> to 1
<span class="sc">P.M.</span> on a Wednesday, as the time originally
fixed fell within the period of Rahuk&#257;lam, which is an
inauspicious hour on that day.</p>
<p>It is considered by a Hindu unlucky to get shaved for ceremonial
purposes in the months of &#256;di, Puratt&#257;si, Margali, and
M&#257;si, and, in the remaining months, Sunday, Tuesday, and Saturday
should be avoided. Further, the star under which a man was born has to
be taken into consideration, and it may happen that an auspicious day
for being shaved does not occur for some weeks. It is on this account
that orthodox Hindus are sometimes compelled to go about with unkempt
chins. Even for anointing the body, auspicious and inauspicious days
are prescribed. Thus, anointing on Sunday causes loss of beauty, on
Monday brings increase of riches, and on Thursday loss of intellect. If
a person is obliged to anoint himself on Sunday, he should put a bit of
the root of oleander (<i>Nerium</i>) in the oil, and heat it before
applying it. This is supposed to avert the evil influences. Similarly
on Tuesday dry earth, on Thursday roots of <i>Cynodou Dactylon</i>, and
on Friday ashes must be used. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is considered auspicious if a girl attains puberty on a Monday,
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, and the omens vary according to the
month in which the first menstrual period occurs. Thus the month of
Vaiy&#257;si ensures prosperity, &#256;ni male issue, M&#257;si
happiness, Margali well-behaved children, Punguni long life and many
children. At the first menstrual ceremony of a Tiyan girl in Malabar,
her aunt, or, if she is married, her husband&rsquo;s sister, pours
gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil over her head, on the top of which a gold
fanam (coin) has been placed. The oil is poured from a little cup made
from a leaf of the jak tree (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>), flows
over the forehead, and is received with the fanam in a dish. It is a
good omen if the coin falls with the obverse upwards.</p>
<p>If a Br&#257;hman woman loses her t&#257;li (marriage badge), it is
regarded as a bad omen for her husband. As a D&#275;va-d&#257;si
(dancing-girl) can never become a widow, the beads in her t&#257;li are
considered to bring good luck to those who wear them. And some people
send the t&#257;li required for a marriage to a D&#275;va-d&#257;si,
who prepares the string for it, and attaches to it black beads from her
own t&#257;li. A D&#275;va-d&#257;si is also deputed to walk at the
head of Hindu marriage processions. Married women do not like to do
this, as they are not proof against evil omens, which the procession
may come across, and it is believed that D&#275;va-d&#257;sis, to whom
widowhood is unknown, possess the power of warding off the effects of
unlucky omens. It may be remarked, <i>en passant</i>, that
D&#275;va-d&#257;sis are not at the present day so much patronised at
Hindu marriages as in former days. Much is due in this direction to the
progress of enlightened ideas, which have of late been strongly put
forward by Hindu social reformers. General Burton narrates<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1032src" href="#xd26e1032" name=
"xd26e1032src">49</a> how a civilian of the old school built a house at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>Bhav&#257;ni, and established a <i>corps de
ballet</i>, i.e., a set of nautch girls, whose accomplishments extended
to singing <i>God Save the King</i>, and this was kept up by their
descendants, so that, when he visited the place in 1852, he was
&ldquo;greeted by the whole party, bedizened in all their finery, and
squalling the National Anthem.&rdquo; With this may be contrasted a
circular from a modern European official, which states that
&ldquo;during my jamabandy (land revenue settlement) tour, people have
sometimes been kind enough to arrange singing or dancing parties, and,
as it would have been discourteous to decline to attend what had cost
money to arrange, I have accepted the compliment in the spirit in which
it was offered. I should, however, be glad if you would let it be
generally known that I am entirely in accord with what is known as the
anti-nautch movement in regard to such performances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was unanimously decided, in 1905, by the Executive Committee of
the Prince and Princess of Wales&rsquo; reception committee, that there
should be no performance by nautch girls at the entertainment to their
Royal Highnesses at Madras.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremonies of &#256;r&#275; Dammaras
(Mar&#257;thi-speaking acrobats) are supervised by an old Basavi woman,
and the marriage badge is tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck by a Basavi
(public woman dedicated to the deity).</p>
<p>When a marriage is contemplated among the Idaiyans (Tamil shepherds)
of Coimbatore, the parents of the prospective bride and bridegroom go
to the temple, and throw before the idol a red and white flower, each
wrapped in a betel leaf. A small child is then told to pick up one of
the leaves. If the one selected contains the white flower, it is
considered auspicious, and the marriage will be contracted. The
D&#275;v&#257;nga weavers, before settling the marriage of a girl,
consult some village goddess or the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>tribal goddess Chaud&#275;swari,
and watch the omens. A lizard chirping on the right is good, and on the
left bad. Sometimes, red and white flowers wrapped in green leaves are
thrown in front of the idol, and the omen is considered good or bad,
according to the flower which a child picks up. Among the hill
Ur&#257;lis of Coimbatore, a flower is placed on the top of a stone or
figure representing the tribal goddess, and, after worship, it is
addressed in the words: &ldquo;Oh! sw&#257;mil (goddess), drop the
flower to the right if the marriage is going to be propitious, and to
the left if otherwise.&rdquo; Should the flower remain on the image
without falling either way, it is greeted as a very happy omen. When a
marriage is in contemplation among the Agamudaiyans (Tamil
cultivators), some close relations of the young man proceed to some
distance northward, and wait for omens. If these are auspicious, they
are satisfied. Some, instead of so doing, go to a temple, and seek the
omens either by placing flowers on the idol, and watching the
directions in which they fall, or by picking up a flower from a large
number strewn in front of the idol. If the flower picked up, and the
one thought of, are of the same colour, it is regarded as a good omen.
Among the Gudig&#257;ras (wood-carvers) of South Canara, the parents of
the couple go to a temple, and receive from the priest some flowers
which have been used in worship. These are counted, and, if their
number is even, the match is arranged. At a marriage among the
Malai&#257;lis of the Kollaimalai hills, the garlands with which the
bridal couple are adorned, are thrown into a well after the t&#257;li
has been tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck. If they float together, it is
an omen that the two will love each other.</p>
<p>Among the Telugu Janappans (gunny-bag makers), on the day fixed for
the betrothal, those assembled wait silently listening for the chirping
of a lizard, which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>an auspicious sign. It is said that the match
is broken off if the chirping is not heard. If the omen proves
auspicious, a small bundle of nine to twelve kinds of pulses and grain
is given by the bridegroom&rsquo;s father to the father of the bride.
This is preserved, and examined several days after the marriage. If the
pulses and grain are in good condition, it is a sign that the newly
married couple will have a prosperous career. During the marriage
ceremonies of the Muhammadan Daknis or Deccanis, two big pots, filled
with water, are placed near the milk-post. They are kept for forty
days, and then examined. If the water remains sweet, and does not
&ldquo;teem with vermin,&rdquo; it is regarded as a good omen. The seed
grains, too, which, as among many Hindu castes, were sown at the time
of the wedding, should by this time have developed into healthy
seedlings. At a Rona (Oriya cultivator) wedding, the D&#275;s&#257;ri
who officiates ties to the ends of the cloths of the bridal couple a
new cloth, to which a quarter-anna piece is attached, betel leaves and
areca nuts, and seven grains of rice. Towards the close of the marriage
rites on the third day, the rice is examined, to see if it is in a good
state of preservation, and its condition is regarded as an omen for
good or evil.</p>
<p>On the occasion of a wedding among the Badagas of the N&#299;lgiris,
a procession goes before dawn on the marriage day to the forest, where
two sticks of <i>Mimusops hexandra</i> are collected, to do duty as the
milk-posts. The early hour is selected, to avoid the chance of coming
across inauspicious objects. At the close of the Agamudaiyan marriage
ceremonies, the twig of <i>Erythrina indica</i> or <i>Odina wodier</i>,
of which the milk-post was made, is planted. If it takes root and
grows, it is regarded as a favourable omen. At a Palli (Tamil
cultivator) wedding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>two lamps, called kuda vilakku (pot light)
and alankara vilakku (ornamental light), are placed by the side of the
milk-post. The former consists of a lighted wick in an earthenware tray
placed on a pot. It is considered an unlucky omen if it goes out before
the conclusion of the ceremonial.</p>
<p>Prior to the betrothal ceremony of the Kammas (Telugu cultivators),
a near relation of the future bridegroom proceeds with a party to the
home of the future bride. On the way thither, they look for omens, such
as the crossing of birds in an auspicious direction. Immediately on the
occurrence of a favourable omen, they burn camphor, and break a
cocoanut, which must split in two with clean edges. One half is sent to
the would-be bridegroom, and the other taken to the bride&rsquo;s
house. When this is reached, she demands the sagunam (omen) cocoanut.
If the first cocoanut does not split properly, others are broken till
the desired result is obtained.</p>
<p>In the Telugu country, the services of a member of the B&#333;ya
caste are required if a Br&#257;hman wishes to perform Vontigadu, a
ceremony by which he hopes to induce favourable auspices, under which
to celebrate a marriage. The story has it that Vontigadu was a
destitute B&#333;ya, who died of starvation. On the morning of the day
on which the ceremony, for which favourable auspices are required, is
performed, a B&#333;ya is invited to the house. He is given a present
of gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil, wherewith to anoint himself. This
done, he returns, carrying in his hand a dagger, on the point of which
a lime has been stuck. He is directed to the cowshed, and there given a
good meal. After finishing the meal, he steals from the shed, and
dashes out of the house, uttering a piercing yell, and waving his
dagger. He on no account looks behind him. The inmates of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>house follow for some distance, throwing water
wherever he has trodden. By this means, all possible evil omens for the
coming ceremony are done away with.</p>
<p>A curious mock marriage ceremony is celebrated among Br&#257;hmans,
when an individual marries a third wife. It is believed that a third
marriage is very inauspicious, and that the bride will become a widow.
To prevent this mishap, the man is made to marry the arka plant
(<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>), which grows luxuriantly in wastelands,
and the real marriage thus becomes the fourth. The bridegroom,
accompanied by a Br&#257;hman priest and another Br&#257;hman, repairs
to a spot where this plant is growing. It is decorated with a cloth and
a piece of string, and symbolised into the sun. All the ceremonies,
such as making h&#333;mam (sacred fire), tying the t&#257;li (marriage
badge), etc., are performed as at a regular marriage, and the plant is
cut down. On rathasapthami day, an orthodox Hindu should bathe his head
and shoulders with arka leaves in propitiation of Surya (the sun). The
leaves are also used during the worship of ancestors by some
Br&#257;hmans. Among the Tangal&#257;n Paraiyans, if a young man dies
before he is married, a ceremony called kannikazhital (removing
bachelorhood) is performed. Before the corpse is laid on the bier, a
garland of arka flowers is placed round its neck, and balls of mud from
a gutter are laid on the head, knees, and other parts of the body. In
some places, a variant of the ceremony consists in the erection of a
mimic marriage booth, which is covered with leaves of the arka plant,
flowers of which are placed round the neck as a garland. Adulterers
were, in former times, seated on a donkey, with their face to the tail,
and marched through the village. The public disgrace was enhanced by
placing a garland of the despised arka leaves on their head.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>Uppiliyan women convicted of immorality are said
to be garlanded with arka flowers, and made to carry a basket of mud
round the village. A Konga Vell&#257;la man, who has been found guilty
of undue intimacy with a widow, is readmitted to the caste by being
taken to the village common, where he is beaten with an arka stick, and
by providing a black sheep for a feast. When a Kuruvikk&#257;ran man
has to submit to trial by ordeal, seven arka leaves are tied to his
palms, and a piece of red-hot iron is placed thereon. His innocence is
established, if he is able to carry it while he takes seven long
strides. The juice of the arka plant is a favourite agent in the hands
of suicides.</p>
<p>At a Br&#257;hman wedding the bridegroom takes a blade of the sacred
dharba grass, passes it between the eyebrows of the bride and throws it
away saying, &ldquo;With this grass I remove the influence of any bad
mark thou mayest possess, which is likely to cause
widowhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a Tamil proverb relating to the selection of a wife, to the
effect that curly hair gives food, thick hair brings milk, and very
stiff hair destroys a family. As a preliminary to marriage among the
Kurubas (Canarese shepherds), the bridegroom&rsquo;s father observes
certain curls (suli) on the head of the proposed bride. Some of these
are believed to forebode prosperity, and others misery to the family
into which the girl enters by marriage. They are, therefore, very
cautious in selecting only such girls as possess curls of good fortune.
One of the good curls is the b&#257;shingam on the forehead, and bad
ones are the p&#275;yan&#257;kallu at the back of the head, and the
edirsuli near the right temple.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1089src"
href="#xd26e1089" name="xd26e1089src">50</a> By the Pallis (Tamil
cultivators) a curl on the forehead is considered as an indication that
the girl will become a widow, and one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>on the back of the head
portends the death of the eldest brother of her husband. By the Tamil
Maravans, a curl on the forehead resembling the head of a snake is
regarded as an evil omen.</p>
<p>A woman, pregnant for the first time, should not see a temple car
adorned with figures of a lion, or look at it when it is being dragged
along with the image of the god seated in it. If she does, the
tradition is that she will give birth to a monster.</p>
<p>In some places, before a woman is confined, the room in which her
confinement is to take place is smeared with cow-dung, and, in the room
at the outer gate, small wet cow-dung cakes are stuck on the wall, and
covered with margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves and cotton
seeds. These are supposed to have a great power in averting evil
spirits, and preventing harm to the newly-born babe or the lying-in
woman.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1103src" href="#xd26e1103" name=
"xd26e1103src">51</a> In the Telugu country, it is the custom among
some castes, <i>e.g.</i>, the K&#257;pus and Gamallas, to place twigs
of <i>Balanites Roxburghii</i> or <i>Calotropis gigantea</i> (arka) on
the floor or in the roof of the lying-in chamber. Sometimes a garland
of old shoes is hung up on the door-post of the chamber. A fire is
kindled, into which pieces of old leather, hair, nails, horns, hoofs,
and bones of animals are thrown, in the belief that the smoke arising
therefrom will protect the mother and child against evil spirits. Among
some classes, when a woman is pregnant, her female friends assemble,
pile up before her door a quantity of rice-husk, and set fire to it. To
one door-post they tie an old shoe, and to the other a bunch of tulsi
(<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>), in order to prevent the entry of any demon. A
bitch is brought in, painted, and marked in the way that the women
daily mark their own foreheads. Incense is burnt, and an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>oblation
placed before it. The woman then makes obeisance to it, and makes a
meal of curry and rice, on which cakes are placed. If there is present
any woman who has not been blessed with children, she seizes some of
the cakes, in the hope that, by so doing, she may ere long have a
child.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1121src" href="#xd26e1121" name=
"xd26e1121src">52</a> In some places, when a woman is in labour, her
relations keep on measuring out rice into a measure close to the
lying-in room, in the belief that delivery will be accelerated thereby.
Sometimes a gun is fired off in an adjacent room with the same object,
and I have heard of a peon (orderly), whose wife was in labour,
borrowing his master&rsquo;s gun, to expedite matters.</p>
<p>Some Hindus in Madras believe that it would be unlucky for a
newly-married couple to visit the museum, as their offspring would be
deformed as the result of the mother having gazed on the skeletons and
stuffed animals.</p>
<p>Twins are sometimes objects of superstition, especially if they are
of different sexes, and the male is born first. The occurrence of such
an event is regarded as foreboding misfortune, which can only be warded
off by marrying the twins to one another, and leaving them to their
fate in the jungle. Cases of this kind have, however, it is said, not
been heard of within recent times.</p>
<p>There is a proverb that a child born with the umbilical cord round
the body will be a curse to the caste. If a child is born with the cord
round its neck like a garland, it is believed to be inauspicious for
its uncle, who is not allowed to see it for ten days, or even longer,
and then a propitiatory ceremony has to be performed. By the Koravas
the birth of a child with the cord round its neck is believed to
portend the death of the father or maternal uncle. This unpleasant
effect is warded off by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>the father or the uncle killing a
fowl, and wearing its entrails round his neck, and afterwards burying
them along with the cord. In other castes it is believed that a child
born with the cord round its neck will be a curse to its maternal
uncle, unless a gold or silver string is placed on the body, and the
uncle sees its image reflected in a vessel of oil. If the cord is
entwined across the breast, and passes under the armpit, it is believed
to be an unlucky omen for the father and paternal uncle. In such cases,
some special ceremony, such as looking into a vessel of oil, is
performed. I am informed by the Rev. S. Nicholson that, if a M&#257;la
(Telugu Pariah) child is born with the cord round its neck, a cocoanut
is immediately offered. If the child survives, a cock is offered to the
gods on the day on which the mother takes her first bath. When the cord
is cut, a coin is placed over the navel for luck. The dried cord is
highly prized as a remedy for sterility. The placenta is placed by the
M&#257;las in a pot, in which are n&#299;m (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>)
leaves, and the whole is buried in some convenient place, generally the
backyard. If this was not done, dogs or other animals might carry off
the placenta, and the child would be of a wandering disposition.</p>
<p>The birth of a Korava child on a new moon night is believed to augur
a notorious thieving future for the infant. Such children are commonly
named Venkatig&#257;du after the god at Tirupati.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1137src" href="#xd26e1137" name="xd26e1137src">53</a> The birth
of a male child on the day in which the constellation Rohini is visible
portends evil to the maternal uncle; and a female born under the
constellation Moolam is supposed to carry misery with her to the house
which she enters by marriage.</p>
<p>D&#333;mb children in Vizagapatam are supposed to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>born
without souls, and to be subsequently chosen as an abode by the soul of
an ancestor. The coming of the ancestor is signalised by the child
dropping a chicken bone which has been thrust into its hand, and much
rejoicing follows among the assembled relations.</p>
<p>By some Valaiyans (Tamil cultivators), the naming of infants is
performed at the Aiyanar temple by any one who is under the influence
of inspiration. Failing such a one, several flowers, each with a name
attached to it, are thrown in front of the idol. A boy, or the priest,
picks up one of the flowers, and the infant receives the name which is
connected with it. In connection with the birth ceremonies of the Koyis
of the God&#257;vari district, the Rev. J. Cain writes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1146src" href="#xd26e1146" name=
"xd26e1146src">54</a> that, on the seventh day, the near relatives and
neighbours assemble together to name the child. Having placed it on a
cot, they put a leaf of the mowha tree (<i>Bassia</i>) in its hand, and
pronounce some name which they think suitable. If the child closes its
hand over the leaf, it is regarded as a sign that it acquiesces, but,
if the child rejects the leaf or cries, they take it as a sign that
they must choose another name, and so throw away the leaf, and
substitute another leaf and name, until the child shows its
approbation.</p>
<p>It is noted,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1155src" href="#xd26e1155"
name="xd26e1155src">55</a> in connection with the death ceremonies of
the Kondhs, that, if a man has been killed by a tiger, purification is
made by the sacrifice of a pig, the head of which is cut off with a
tangi (axe) by a P&#257;no, and passed between the legs of the men in
the village, who stand in a line astraddle. It is a bad omen to him, if
the head touches any man&rsquo;s legs. According to another account,
the head of the decapitated pig is placed in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>stream,
and, as it floats down, it has to pass between the legs of the
villagers. If it touches the legs of any of them, it forebodes that he
will be killed by a tiger.</p>
<p>The sight of a cat, on getting out of bed, is extremely unlucky, and
he who sees one will fail in all his undertakings during the day.
&ldquo;I faced the cat this morning,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did you see a cat
this morning?&rdquo; are common sayings when one fails in anything. The
Paraiyans are said to be very particular about omens, and, if, when a
Paraiyan sets out to arrange a marriage with a certain girl, a cat or a
valiyan (a bird) crosses his path, he will give up the girl. I have
heard of a superstitious European police officer, who would not start
in search of a criminal, because he came across a cat.</p>
<p>House dogs should, if they are to bring good luck, possess more than
eighteen visible claws. If a dog scratches the wall of a house, it will
be broken into by thieves; and, if it makes a hole in the ground within
a cattle-shed, the cattle will be stolen. A dog approaching a person
with a bit of shoe-leather augurs success; with flesh, gain; with a
meaty bone, good luck; with a dry bone, death. If a dog enters a house
with wire or thread in its mouth, the master of the house must expect
to be put in prison. A dog barking on the roof of a house during the
dry weather portends an epidemic, and in the wet season a heavy fall of
rain. There is a proverb &ldquo;Like a dying dog climbing the
roof,&rdquo; which is said of a person who is approaching his ruin. The
omen also signifies the death of several members of the family, so the
dog&rsquo;s ears and tail are cut off, and rice is steeped in the
blood. A goat which has climbed on to the roof is treated in like
manner, dragged round the house, or slaughtered. At the conclusion of
the first menstrual ceremony of a K&#257;ppiliyan (Canarese farmer)
girl, some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>food is placed near the entrance to the house,
which a dog is allowed to eat. While so doing, it receives a severe
beating. The more noise it makes, the better is the omen for the girl
having a large family. If the animal does not howl, it is supposed that
the girl will bear no children.</p>
<p>The sight of a jackal is very lucky to one proceeding on an errand.
Its cry to the east and north of a village foretells something good for
the villagers, whereas the cry at midday means an impending calamity.
If a jackal cries towards the south in answer to the call of another
jackal, some one will be hung; and, if it cries towards the west, some
one will be drowned. A bachelor who sees a jackal running may expect to
be married shortly. If the offspring of a primipara dies, it is
sometimes buried in a place where jackals can get at it. It is believed
that, if a jackal does not make a sumptuous meal off the corpse, the
woman will not be blessed with more children. The corpses of the
Koramas of Mysore are buried in a shallow grave, and a pot of water is
placed on the mound raised over it. Should the spot be visited during
the night by a pack of jackals, and the water drunk by them to slake
their thirst after feasting on the dead body, the omen is accepted as a
proof that the liberated spirit has fled to the realms of the dead, and
will never trouble man, woman, child, or cattle.</p>
<p>When a person rises in the morning, he should not face or see a
cow&rsquo;s head, but should see its hinder parts. This is in
consequence of a legend that a cow killed a Br&#257;hman by goring him
with its horns. In some temples, a cow is made to stand in front of the
building with its tail towards it, so that any one entering may see its
face. It is said that, if a cow voids urine at the time of purchase, it
is considered a very good omen, but, if she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>passes
dung, a bad omen. The hill Kondhs will not cut the crops with a sickle
having a serrated edge, such as is used by the Oriyas, but use a
straight-edged knife. The crops, after they have been cut, are threshed
by hand, and not with the aid of cattle. The serrated sickle is not
used, because it produces a sound like that of cattle grazing, which
would be unpropitious. If cattle were used in threshing the crop, it is
believed that the earth-god would feel insulted by the dung and urine
of the animals.</p>
<p>A timber merchant at Calicut in Malabar is said to have spent more
than a thousand rupees in propitiating the spirit of a deceased
Br&#257;hman under the following circumstances. He had built a new
house, and, on the morning after the kutti p&#363;ja (house-warming)
ceremony, his wife and children were coming to occupy it. Just as they
were entering the grounds, a cow ran against one of the children, and
knocked it down. This augured evil, and, in a few days, the child was
attacked by smallpox. One child after another caught the disease, and
at last the man&rsquo;s wife also contracted it. They all recovered,
but the wife was laid up with some uterine disorder. An astrologer was
sent for, and said that the site on which the house was built was once
the property of a Br&#257;hman, whose spirit still haunted it, and must
be appeased. Expensive ceremonies were performed by Br&#257;hmans for a
fortnight. The house was sold to a Br&#257;hman priest for a nominal
price. A gold image of the deceased Br&#257;hman was made, and, after
the purification ceremonies had been carried out, taken to the sacred
shrine at R&#257;m&#275;svaram, where arrangements were made to have
daily worship performed to it. The house, in its purified state, was
sold back by the Br&#257;hman priest. The merchant&rsquo;s wife
travelled by train to Madras, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>undergo treatment at the
Maternity Hospital. The astrologer predicted that the displeasure of
the spirit would be exhibited on the way by the breaking of dishes and
by furniture catching fire&mdash;a strange prediction, because the bed
on which the woman was lying caught fire by a spark from the engine.
After the spirit had been thus propitiated, there was peace in the
house.</p>
<p>It is noted<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1178src" href="#xd26e1178"
name="xd26e1178src">56</a> that, in the middle of the threshold of
nearly all the gateways of the ruined fortifications round the Bellary
villages may be noticed a roughly carved cylindrical or conical stone,
something like a lingam. This is the boddu-r&#257;yi, literally the
navel-stone, and so the middle stone. It was planted there when the
fort was first built, and is affectionately regarded as being the
boundary of the village site. Once a year, in May, just before the
sowing season commences, a ceremony takes place in connection with it.
Reverence is first made to the bullocks of the village, and in the
evening they are driven through the gateway past the boddu-r&#257;yi,
with tom-toms, flutes, and other kinds of music. The Barike (village
servant) next does p&#363;ja (worship) to the stone, and then a string
of mango leaves is tied across the gateway above it. The villagers now
form sides, one party trying to drive the bullocks through the gate,
and the other trying to keep them out. The greatest uproar and
confusion naturally follow, and, in the midst of the turmoil, some
bullock or other eventually breaks through the guardians of the gate,
and gains the village. If that first bullock is a red one, the red
grains on the red soil will flourish in the coming season. If he is
white, white crops, such as cotton and white cholam, will prosper. If
he is red and white, both kinds will do well. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>Various Oriya castes worship the goddess Lakshmi on Thursdays, in
the month of November, which are called <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1184" title="Source: Lakshi">Lakshmi</span> varam, or
Lakshmi&rsquo;s day. The goddess is represented by a basket filled with
grain, whereon some place a hair-ball which has been vomited by a cow.
The ball is called g&#257;ya panghula, and is usually one or two inches
in diameter. The owner of a cow which has vomited such a ball, regards
it as a propitious augury for the prosperity of his family. A feast is
held on the day on which the ball is vomited, and, after the ball has
been worshipped, it is carefully wrapped up, and kept in a box, in
which it remains till it is required for further worship. Some people
believe that the ball continues to grow year by year, and regard this
as a very good sign. Bulls are said not to vomit the balls, and only
very few cows do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Throughout India,&rdquo; Mr J. D. E. Holmes
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1190src" href="#xd26e1190" name=
"xd26e1190src">57</a> &ldquo;but more especially in the Southern
Presidency, among the native population, the value of a horse or ox
principally depends on the existence and situation of certain
hair-marks on the body of the animal. These hair-marks are formed by
the changes in the direction in which the hair grows at certain places,
and, according to their shape, are called a crown, ridge, or feather
mark. The relative position of these marks is supposed to indicate that
the animal will bring good luck to the owner and his relatives. There
is a saying that a man may face a rifle and escape, but he cannot avoid
the luck, good or evil, foretold by hair-marks. So much are the people
influenced by these omens that they seldom keep an animal with unlucky
marks, and would not allow their mares to be covered by a stallion
having unpropitious marks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is recorded by Bishop Whitehead<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1198src" href="#xd26e1198" name="xd26e1198src">58</a> that
&ldquo;we went to see the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja (of Mysore) at his
stables, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>he showed us his fine stud of horses. Among them
was the State horse, which is only used for religious ceremonies, and
is ridden only by the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja himself. It is pure white,
without spot or blemish, and has the five lucky marks. This horse came
from Kathiawar, and is now about twenty years old. The
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is trying to get another, to replace it when it
dies. But it is not easy to get one with the unusual points
required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two deaths occurring in a family in quick succession, were once
believed to be the result of keeping an unlucky horse in the stable. I
have heard of a Eurasian police officer, who attributed the theft of
five hundred rupees, his official transfer to an unhealthy district,
and other strokes of bad luck, to the purchase of a horse with unlucky
curls. All went well after he had got rid of the animal.</p>
<p>From a recent note on beliefs about the bull,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1209src" href="#xd26e1209" name="xd26e1209src">59</a> I gather
that &ldquo;Manu enjoins a grihasta or householder to always travel
with beasts which are well broken in, swift, endowed with lucky marks,
and perfect in colour and form, without urging them much with the goad.
Marks are accounted lucky if they appear in certain forms, and at
certain spots. One of these marks is usually known as sudi in Telugu,
and suli in Tamil. A sudi is nothing but a whorl or circlet of hair, a
properly formed sudi being perfectly round in form, and nearly
resembling the sudivalu, the chakrayudha of Vishnu, which is a short
circular weapon commonly known as the discus of Vishnu. Every ox should
have at least two of these circlets or twists of hair, one on the face,
and one on the back, right about its centre. Two curls may occur on the
face, but they should not be one above the other, in which case they
are known <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>as kod&#275; mel kod&#275;, or umbrella above
umbrella. The purchaser of such a bull, it is believed, will soon have
some mishap in his house. Some, however, hold that this curl is not
really so bad as it is supposed to be. If the curls are side by side,
they are accounted lucky. In that case they are known as dam&#257;ra
suli, or double kettle-drum circlet, from the kettle-drums placed on
either side of Br&#257;hmani bulls in temple processions. It is
sometimes known as the kaly&#257;na (marriage) suli, because such a
kettle-drum is often used in marriage processions. A curl on the hump
is held to be a very good one, bringing prosperity to the purchaser. It
is known as the kirita suli, or the crown circlet. The dewlaps should
have a curl on either side, or none. A curl on only one side is
described as not lucky. On the back of the animal, a curl must be
perfectly round. If it is elongated, and stretches on one side, it is
known as the p&#257;dai suli, or the bier circlet. Kattiri suli, or the
scissor circlet, is found usually in the region of the belly, and is an
unlucky sign. On the body is sometimes found the p&#363;r&#257;n suli,
the circlet named after the centipede from its supposed resemblance to
it. On the legs is often found the velangu suli, or chain circlet, from
its being like a chain bound round the legs. Both these are said to be
bad marks, and bulls having them are invariably hard to sell. Attempts
at erasure of unlucky marks are frequently noticed, for the reason that
an animal with a bad mark is scarcely, if ever, sold to advantage. One
of the most common and most effective ways of erasing an unlucky mark
is to brand it pretty deep, so that the hair disappears, and the curl
is no more observable. Animals so branded are regarded with
considerable suspicion, and it is often difficult to secure purchasers
for them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=

<p>The following are some of the marks on horses and cattle recorded by
Mr Holmes:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1220src" href="#xd26e1220" name=
"xd26e1220src">60</a>&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="sc">Horses</span></p>
<p>1. Deobund (having control over evil spirits), also termed
d&#275;vuman or d&#275;vumani, said by Muhammadans to represent the
Prophet&rsquo;s finger, and by Hindus to represent a temple bell. This
mark is a ridge, one to three inches long, situated between the throat
and counter along the line of the trachea. It is the most lucky mark a
horse can possess. It is compared to the sun, and, therefore, when it
is present, none of the evil stars can shine, and all unlucky omens are
overruled.</p>
<p>2. Khorta-gad (peg-driver), or khila-gad, is a ridge of hair
directed downwards on one or both hind-legs. It is said that no horse
in the stable will be sold, so long as a horse with this mark is
kept.</p>
<p>3. Badi (fetter), a ridge of hair directed upwards on one or both
forearms on the outer side, and said to indicate that the owner of the
animal will be sent to jail.</p>
<p>4. Thanni (teat). Teat-like projections on the sheath of the male

<p>5. Bhashicam suli is a crown on the forehead above the line of the
eyes, named after the chaplet worn by bride and bridegroom during the
marriage ceremony. If the purchaser be a bachelor or widower, this mark
indicates that he will marry soon. If the purchaser be a married man,
he will either have the misfortune to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>lose his wife and marry
again, or the good fortune to obtain two wives.</p>
<p>6. Mukkanti suli. Three crowns on the forehead, arranged in the form
of a triangle, said to represent the three eyes of Siva, of which the
one on the forehead will, if opened, burn up all things within the
range of vision.</p>
<p>7. P&#257;dai suli. Two ridges of hair on the back on either side of
the middle line, indicating that the purchaser will soon need a
coffin.</p>
<p>8. Tattu suli. A crown situated on the back between the points of
the hips, indicating that any business undertaken by the purchaser will
fail.</p>
<p>9. A bullock with numerous spots over the body, like a deer, is
considered very lucky.</p>
<p>The following quaint omen is recorded by Bishop Whitehead.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1263src" href="#xd26e1263" name=
"xd26e1263src">61</a> At a certain village, when a pig is sacrificed to
the village goddess Angalamman, its neck is first cut slightly, and the
blood allowed to flow on to some boiled rice placed on a plantain leaf,
and then the rice soaked in its own blood is given to the pig to eat.
If the pig eats it, the omen is good, if not, the omen is bad; but, in
any case, the pig has its head cut off by the p&#363;j&#257;ri
(priest).</p>
<p>If a Br&#257;hmani kite (<i>Haliastur indus</i>), when flying, is
seen carrying something in its beak, the omen is considered very
auspicious. The sight of this bird on a Sunday morning is also
auspicious, so, on this day, people may be seen throwing pieces of
mutton or lumps of butter to it.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1273src"
href="#xd26e1273" name="xd26e1273src">62</a></p>
<p>If an owl takes refuge in a house, the building is at once deserted,
the doors are closed, and the house is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>not occupied for six
months, when an expiatory sacrifice must be performed. Br&#257;hmans
are fed, and the house can only be re-entered after the proper hour has
been fixed upon. This superstition only refers to a thatched house; a
terraced house need not be vacated.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1283src"
href="#xd26e1283" name="xd26e1283src">63</a> Ill-luck will follow,
should an owl sit on the housetop, or perch on the bough of a tree near
the house. One screech forebodes death; two screeches forebode success
in any approaching undertaking; three, the addition of a girl to the
family by marriage; four, a disturbance; five, that the hearer will
travel. Six screeches foretell the coming of guests; seven, mental
distress; eight, sudden death; and nine signify favourable results. A
species of owl, called pullu, is a highly dreaded bird. It is supposed
to cause all kinds of illness to children, resulting in emaciation. At
the sound of the screeching, children are taken into a room, to avoid
its furtive and injurious gaze. Various propitiatory ceremonies are
performed by specialists to secure its good-will. Amulets are worn by
children as a preventive against its evil influences. To warn off the
unwelcome intruder, broken pots, painted with black and white dots, are
set up on housetops. In the Bellary district, the flat roofs of many
houses may be seen decked with rags, fluttering from sticks, piles of
broken pots, and so forth. These are to scare away owls, which, it is
said, sometimes vomit up blood, and sometimes milk. If they sit on a
house and bring up blood, it is bad for the inmates; if milk, good. But
the risk of the vomit turning out to be blood is apparently more feared
than the off chance of its proving to be milk is hoped for, and it is
thought best to be on the safe side, and keep the owl at a
distance.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1286src" href="#xd26e1286" name=
"xd26e1286src">64</a> The Kondhs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>believe that, if an owl hoots
over the roof of a house, or on a tree close thereto, a death will
occur in the family at an early date. If the bird hoots close to a
village, but outside it, the death of one of the villagers will follow.
For this reason, it is pelted with stones, and driven off. The
waist-belt of a Koraga, whom I saw at Udipi in South Canara, was made
of owl bones.</p>
<p>Should a crow come near the house, and caw in its usual rapid
raucous tones, it means that calamity is impending. But, should the
bird indulge in its peculiar prolonged guttural note, happiness will
ensue. If a crow keeps on cawing incessantly at a house, it is believed
to foretell the coming of a guest. The belief is so strong that some
housewives prepare more food than is required for the family. There is
also an insect called virunthoo poochee, or guest insect. If crows are
seen fighting in front of a house, news of a death will shortly be
heard. In some places, if a crow enters a house, it must be vacated for
not less than three months, and, before it can be re-occupied, a
purification ceremony must be performed, and a number of Br&#257;hmans
fed. Among the poorer classes, who are unable to incur this expense, it
is not uncommon to allow a house which has been thus polluted to fall
into ruins.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1293src" href="#xd26e1293" name=
"xd26e1293src">65</a> In Malabar, there is a belief that ill-luck will
result if, on certain days, a crow soils one&rsquo;s person or clothes.
The evil can only be removed by bathing with the clothes on, and
propitiating Br&#257;hmans. On other days, the omen is a lucky one. On
sr&#257;dh (memorial) days, pindams (balls of cooked rice) are offered
to the crows. If they do not touch them, the ceremony is believed not
to have been properly performed, and the wishes of the dead man are not
satisfied. If the crows, after repeated trials, fail to eat the rice,
the celebrant makes up his mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>to satisfy these wishes, and the
crows are then supposed to relish the balls. On one occasion, my
Br&#257;hman assistant was in camp with me on the Palni hills, the
higher altitudes of which are uninhabited by crows, and he had perforce
to march down to the plains, in order to perform the annual ceremony in
memory of his deceased father. On another occasion, a Br&#257;hman who
was staying on the Palni hills telegraphed to the village of Periakulam
for two crows, which duly arrived confined in a cage. The sr&#257;dh
ceremony was performed, and the birds were then set at liberty. On the
last day of the death ceremonies of the Odd&#275;s (navvies), some rice
is cooked, and placed on an arka (<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>) leaf as
an offering to the crows. The arka plant, which grows luxuriantly on
waste lands, is, it may be noted, used by Br&#257;hmans for the
propitiation of rishis (sages) and pithrus (ancestors).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1301src" href="#xd26e1301" name=
"xd26e1301src">66</a> For seven days after the death of a Paniyan of
Malabar, a little rice gruel is placed near the grave by the Chemmi
(priest), who claps his hands as a signal to the evil spirits in the
vicinity, who, in the shape of a pair of crows, are supposed to partake
of the food, which is hence called k&#257;ka conji, or crow&rsquo;s
gruel. On the third day after the death of a B&#275;dar (Canarese
cultivator), a woman brings to the graveside some luxuries in the way
of food, which is mixed up in a winnowing tray into three portions, and
placed in front of three stones set over the head, abdomen, and legs of
the deceased, for crows to partake of. On the sixth day after the death
of a Korava, the chief mourner kills a fowl, and mixes its blood with
rice. This he places, with betel leaves and areca nuts, near the grave.
If it is carried off by crows, everything is considered to have been
settled satisfactorily. When a jungle Ur&#257;li has been
excommunicated from his caste, he must kill a sheep or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>goat
before the elders, and mark his forehead with its blood. He then gives
a feast to the assembly, and puts part of the food on the roof of his
house. If the crows eat it, he is received back into the caste. A
native clerk some time ago took leave in anticipation of sanction, on
receipt of news of a death in his family at a distant town. His excuse
was that his elder brother had, on learning that his son had seen two
crows <i>in coitu</i>, sent him a post-card stating that the son was
dead. The boy turned out to be alive, but the card, it was explained,
was sent owing to a superstitious belief that, if a person sees two
crows engaged in sexual congress, he will die unless one of his
relations sheds tears. To avert this catastrophe, false news as to the
death are sent by post or telegraph, and subsequently corrected by a
letter or telegram announcing that the individual is alive. A white
(albino) crow, which made its appearance in the city of Madras a
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1312" title="Source: fews">few</span> years
ago, caused considerable interest among the residents of the locality,
as it was regarded as a very good omen.</p>
<p>Among some classes in Mysore, there is a belief that, if a death
occurs in a house on Tuesday or Friday, another death will speedily
follow unless a fowl is tied to one corner of the bier. The fowl is
buried with the corpse. Those castes which do not eat fowls replace it
by the bolt of the door.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1317src" href=
"#xd26e1317" name="xd26e1317src">67</a> Among the Tamils, if a burial
takes place on a Saturday, a fowl must be buried or burnt, or another
death will shortly occur in the family. There is a Tamil proverb that a
Saturday corpse will not go alone. When a fowl is <span class="corr"
id="xd26e1323" title="Source: sacrified">sacrificed</span> to the deity
by the jungle Paliyans of the Palni hills, the head ought to be severed
at one blow, as this is a sign of the satisfaction of the god for the
past, and of protection for the future. Should the head still hang,
this would be a bad omen, foreboding calamities for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>ensuing
year.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1328src" href="#xd26e1328" name=
"xd26e1328src">68</a> An interesting rite in connection with pregnancy
ceremonies among the Odd&#275;s (navvies) is the presentation of a fowl
or two to the pregnant woman by her maternal uncle. The birds are
tended with great care, and, if they lay eggs abundantly, it is a sign
that the woman will be prolific.</p>
<p>By some it is considered unlucky to keep pigeons about a
dwelling-house, as they are believed, on account of their habit of
standing on one leg, to lead to poverty. The temple or blue-rock pigeon
is greatly venerated by Natives, who consider themselves highly
favoured if the birds build in their houses. Should a death occur in a
house where there are tame pigeons, all the birds will, it is said, at
the time of the funeral, circle thrice round the loft, and leave the
locality for ever. House sparrows are supposed to possess a similar
characteristic, but, before quitting the house of mourning, they will
pull every straw out of their nests. Sparrows are credited with
bringing good luck to the house in which they build their nests. For
this purpose, when a house is under construction, holes are left in the
walls or ceiling, or earthen pots are hung on the walls by means of
nails, as an attractive site for nesting. One method of attracting
sparrows to a house is to make a noise with rupees as in the act of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1333" title=
"Source: cointing">counting</span> out coins.</p>
<p>There are experts who are able to interpret the significance of the
chirping of lizards, which, <i>inter alia</i>, foretells the approach
of a case of snake-bite, and whether the patient will die or not. The
fall of a lizard on different parts of the body is often taken as an
omen for good or evil, according as it alights on the right or left
side, hand or foot, head or shoulders. A Native of Cochin foretold from
the chirping of a lizard that a robbery would take <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>place at
a certain temple. In accordance with the prophecy, the temple jewels
were looted, and the prophet was sent to prison under suspicion of
being an accomplice of the thieves, but subsequently released. The
hook-swinging ceremony is said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1343src"
href="#xd26e1343" name="xd26e1343src">69</a> to be sometimes performed
after the consent of the goddess has been obtained. If a lizard is
heard chirping on the right, it is regarded as a sign of her consent.
It is believed that the man who is swung suffers no pain if the cause
is a good one, but excruciating agony if it is a bad one.</p>
<p>If an &ldquo;iguana&rdquo; (<i>Varanus</i>) enters a house,
misfortune is certain to occur within a year, unless the house is shut
up for six months. The appearance of a tortoise in a house, or in a
field which is being ploughed, is inauspicious. In the Cuddapah
district, a cultivator applied for remission of rent, because one of
his fields had been left waste owing to a tortoise making its
appearance in it. If, under these circumstances, the field had been
cultivated, the man, his wife, or his cattle, would have died. It was
pointed out that, as the tortoise was one of Vishnu&rsquo;s
incarnations, it should have been considered as an honour that the
animal visited the field; but the reply was that a tortoise would be
honoured in the water, but not on the land.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1351src" href="#xd26e1351" name="xd26e1351src">70</a></p>
<p>The sight of two snakes coiled round each other in sexual congress
is considered to portend some great evil. The presence of a rat-snake
(<i>Zamenis mucosus</i>) in a house at night is believed to bring good
fortune to the inmates. Its evil influence is in its tail, a blow from
which will cause a limb to shrink in size and waste away.</p>
<p>In a valley named Rapuri Kanama in the Cuddapah district, there is a
pond near a Siva temple to Gundheswara. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>Those desirous of getting
children, wealth, etc., should go there with a pure heart, bathe in the
pond, and then worship at the temple. After this, they should take a
wild pine-apple leaf, and place it on the border of the pond. If their
wishes are to be granted, a crab rises from the water, and bites the
leaf in two. If their wishes will not be granted, the crab rises, but
leaves the leaf untouched. If, however, the person has not approached
the pond with a pure heart, he will be set upon by a swarm of bees,
which live in the vicinity, and will be driven off.<a class="noteref"

<p>If the nest of a clay-building insect is found in a house, the birth
of a child is foretold; if a mud nest, of a male child; if a nest made

<p class="first">There is a belief that the urine of a wild monkey
(lang&#363;r) called kondamuccha, which it discharges in a thick
stream, possesses the power of curing rheumatic pains, if applied to
the affected part with a mixture of garlic. Some of the poorer classes
in the villages of Kurnool obtain a sale even for stones on which this
monkey has urinated, and hill people suffering from chronic fever
sometimes drink its blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1383src" href=
"#xd26e1383" name="xd26e1383src">1</a> I am informed by Mr A. Ff.
Martin, that he has seen a Muduvar on the Travancore hills much pulled
down by fever seize an expiring black monkey (<i>Semnopithecus
johni</i>), and suck the blood from its jugular vein. Childless Muduvar
couples are dieted to make them fruitful, the principal diet for the
man being plenty of black monkey. The flesh of the black monkey
(N&#299;lgiri lang&#363;r) is sold in the N&#299;lgiri bazaars as a
cure for whooping-cough. When Savara (hill tribe in Ganjam) children
are seriously ill and emaciated, offerings are said by Mr G. V.
Ramamurthi Pantulu to be made to monkeys, not in the belief that the
illness is caused by them, but because the sick child, in its wasted
condition, has the attenuated figure of these animals. The offerings
consist of rice and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span>other articles of food, which are placed in
baskets suspended from branches of trees in the jungle.</p>
<p>Some years ago, a drinking fountain was erected at the Madras
Museum, in which the water issued from the mouth of a lion. It entirely
failed in its object, as the Native visitors would not use it, because
the animal was represented in the act of vomiting.</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr C. Hayavadana Rao that the B&#275;p&#257;ris,
who are traders and carriers between the hills and plains in the
Vizagapatam Agency tracts, regard themselves as immune from the attacks
of tigers, if they take certain precautions. Most of them have to pass
through places infested with these beasts, and their favourite method
of keeping them off is as follows. As soon as they encamp at a place,
they level a square bit of ground, and light fires in it, round which
they pass the night. It is their firm belief that the tiger will not
enter the square, from fear lest it should become blind, and eventually
be shot. Mr Hayavadana Rao was once travelling towards Malkangiri from
Jeypore, when he fell in with a party of B&#275;p&#257;ris thus
encamped. At that time the villages about Malkangiri were being ravaged
by a notorious man-eater. In connection with man-eating tigers, Mr S.
M. Fraser narrates<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1395src" href=
"#xd26e1395" name="xd26e1395src">2</a> that, in Mysore, a man-eater was
said to have attacked parties bearing corpses to the
burning-ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The acquisition,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;of
such a curious taste may perhaps be explained by the following passage
in a letter from the Amildar. It is a custom among the villagers here
not to burn or bury the dead bodies of pregnant females, but to expose
them in the neighbouring jungles to be eaten by vultures and wild
beasts. The body is tied to a tree, in a sitting posture, and a pot of
water is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>put close by. Not long ago some cowherd boys came
across the dead body of a woman tied to a tree, and noticed the
foot-prints of a tiger round it, but the body was untouched. The boys
cut the rope binding the body, which fell to the ground, and the next
day the corpse was found eaten away by the tiger.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The village of Hulikal, or tiger&rsquo;s stone, on the N&#299;lgiris
is so called because in it a Badaga once killed a notorious man-eater.
The spot where the beast was buried is shown near the Pillaiyar
(Gan&#275;sa) temple, and is marked by three stones. It is said that
there was formerly a stone image of the slain tiger
thereabouts.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1408src" href="#xd26e1408"
name="xd26e1408src">3</a> When a tiger enters the dwelling of a Savara
(hill tribe in Ganjam) and carries off an inmate, the village is said
to be deserted, and sacrifices are offered to some spirits by the
inhabitants. It is noted by Mr F. Fawcett<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1411src" href="#xd26e1411" name="xd26e1411src">4</a> that the
Savaras have names for numerals up to twelve only. This is accounted
for by a story that, long ago, some Savaras were measuring grain in a
field, and, when they had completed twelve measures, a tiger pounced on
them, and devoured them. So, ever after, they have not dared to have a
numeral above twelve for fear of a tiger repeating the performance. In
the Vizagapatam district, a ballad is sung by the D&#257;saris (a
mendicant caste) about the goddess Yerakamma, who is reputed to have
been the child of D&#257;sari parents, and to have had the possession
of second sight foretold by a Yerukala fortune-teller. She eventually
married, and one day begged her husband not to go to his field, as she
was sure he would be killed by a tiger if he did. He went
notwithstanding, and was slain as she had foreseen. She killed herself
by committing sati (suttee, or burning <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>of the living widow) on
the spot where her shrine still stands. The Muduvars are said by Mr
Martin to share with other jungle folk the belief that, if any animal
is killed by a tiger or leopard so as to lie north and south, it will
not be eaten by the beast of prey. Nor will it be revisited, so that
sitting over a &ldquo;kill&rdquo; which has fallen north and south, in
the hope of getting a shot at the returning tiger or leopard, is a
useless proceeding. The Billava toddy-drawers believe that, if the
spathe of the palm tree is beaten with the bone of a buffalo which has
been killed by a tiger, the yield of toddy will, if the bone has not
touched the ground, be greater than if an ordinary bone is used.</p>
<p>I once received an application for half a pound of tiger&rsquo;s
fat, presumably for medicinal purposes. The bones of tigers and
leopards ground into powder, and mixed with their fat, gingelly
(<i>Sesamum</i>) oil, and a finely powdered blue stone, make an
ointment for the cure of syphilitic sores. The bones of a leopard or
hy&aelig;na, ground into powder and made into a paste with ox-gall and
musk, are said to be a useful ointment for application to rheumatic
joints. The addition of the fat of tigers or leopards makes the
ointment more effective. I am told that when, on one occasion, a
European shot a tiger, the Natives were so keen on securing some of the
fat, that the shik&#257;ris (hunters) came to him to decide as to the
proper distribution among themselves and the camp servants.</p>
<p>The leopard is looked upon as in some way sacred by the hill Kondhs.
They object to a dead leopard being carried through their villages, and
oaths are taken on a leopard&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>Writing in 1873, Dr Francis Day states<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1427src" href="#xd26e1427" name="xd26e1427src">5</a> that
&ldquo;at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>Cannanore (in Malabar), the R&#257;jah&rsquo;s cat
appears to be exercising a deleterious influence on one branch at least
of the fishing, viz., that for sharks. It appears that, in olden times,
one fish daily was taken from each boat as a perquisite for the
R&#257;jah&rsquo;s cat, or the poocha meen (cat-fish) collection. The
cats apparently have not augmented so much as the fishing boats, so
this has been converted into a money payment of two pies a day on each
successful boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with cats, there is a tradition that a J&#333;gi
(Telugu mendicant) bridegroom, before tying the bottu (marriage badge)
on his bride&rsquo;s neck, had to tie it by means of a string dyed with
turmeric round the neck of a female cat. People sometimes object to the
catching of cats by J&#333;gis for food, as the detachment of a single
hair from the body of a cat is considered a heinous offence. To
overcome the objection, the J&#333;gi says that he wants the animal for
a marriage ceremony. On one occasion, I saw a M&#257;diga (Telugu
Pariah) carrying home a bag full of kittens, which he said he was going
to eat. Some time ago, some prisoners, who called themselves
Billaik&#257;vus (cat-eaters), were confined in the Vizagapatam jail. I
am informed that these people are M&#257;la Paidis, who eat cat
flesh.</p>
<p>The gun with which a wolf has been shot falls under some evil
influence, and it is said not to shoot straight afterwards. Hence some
shik&#257;ris (hunters) will not shoot at a wolf.</p>
<p>The hy&aelig;na is believed to beat to death, or strangle with its
tail, those whom it seizes. The head of a hy&aelig;na is sometimes
buried in cattle-sheds, to prevent cattle disease. Its incisor teeth
are tied round the loins of a woman in labour, to lessen the
pains.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1438src" href="#xd26e1438" name=

<p>There is a belief that, when a bear seizes a man, it tickles him to

external appearance of the kidneys, to gain an additional pair of these
organs every year of their life. They are believed to collect ripe
wood-apples (<i>Feronia elephantum</i>) during the season, and store
them in a secure place in the forest. After a large quantity has been
collected, they remove the rind, and heap together all the pulp. They
then bring honey and the petals of sweet-smelling flowers, put them on
the heap of pulp, thresh them with their feet and sticks in their
hands, and, when the whole has become a consistent mass, feast on it.
The V&#275;dans (hunters) watch them when so engaged, drive them off,
and rob them of their feast, which they carry off, and sell as karadi
panchamritham, or bear delicacy made of five ingredients. The ordinary
ingredients of panchamritham are slices of plantain (banana) fruits,
jaggery (crude sugar) or sugar, cocoanut scrapings, gh&#299; (clarified
butter), honey, and cardamom seeds.</p>
<p>It is believed that the flesh or blood of some animals, which have
certain organs largely developed, will cure disease of corresponding
organs in the human subject. Thus, the flesh of the jackal, which is
credited with the possession of very powerful lungs, is said to be a
remedy for asthma.</p>
<p>By the jungle Paliyans of the Palni hills, the following device is
adopted to protect themselves from the attacks of wild animals, the
leopard in particular. Four jackals&rsquo; tails are planted in four
different spots, chosen so as to include the area in which they wish to
be safe from the brute. Even if a leopard entered the magic square,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>it could do the Paliyan no harm, as its mouth is
locked.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1457src" href="#xd26e1457" name=

<p>There is a belief that the urine of wild dogs (<i>Cyon
dukhunensis</i>) is extremely acrid, and that they sprinkle with it the
bushes through which they drive their prey (deer and wild pigs), and
then rush upon the latter, when blinded by the pungent fluid. According
to another version, they jerk the urine into their victim&rsquo;s eyes
with their tails.</p>
<p>The Koyis of the God&#257;vari district are said by the Rev. J.
Cain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1467src" href="#xd26e1467" name=
"xd26e1467src">9</a> to hold in reverence the P&#257;ndava brothers,
Arjuna and Bh&#299;ma, and claim descent from the latter by his
marriage with a wild woman of the woods. The wild dogs or dhols are
regarded as the d&#363;tas or messengers of the brothers, and they
would on no account kill a dhol, even though it should attack their
favourite calf. They even regard it as imprudent to interfere with
these d&#363;tas, when they wish to feast upon their cattle. The long
black beetles, which appear in large numbers at the beginning of the
hot weather, are called by the Koyis the P&#257;ndava flock of
goats.</p>
<p>At a sale of cattle, the vendor sometimes takes a small quantity of
straw in his hand, and, putting some cow-dung on it, presents it to the
purchaser.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1472src" href="#xd26e1472" name=
"xd26e1472src">10</a> The five products of the cow, known as
p&#257;nchagavyam&mdash;milk, curds, butter, urine, and
f&aelig;ces&mdash;are taken by Hindus to remove pollution from
confinement, a voyage across the seas, and other causes. It is on
record<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1475src" href="#xd26e1475" name=
"xd26e1475src">11</a> that the Tanjore Nayakar, having betrayed Madura
and suffered for it, was told by his Br&#257;hman advisers that he had
better <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>be born again. So a colossal cow was cast in
bronze, and the Nayakar shut up inside. The wife of his Br&#257;hman
guru (religious preceptor) received him in her arms, rocked him on her
knees, and caressed him on her breast, and he tried to cry like a baby.
It is recorded by Frazer<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1483src" href=
"#xd26e1483" name="xd26e1483src">12</a> that, when a Hindu
child&rsquo;s horoscope portends misfortune or crime, he is born again
from a cow thus. Being dressed in scarlet, and tied on a new sieve, he
is passed between the hind-legs of a cow forward through the fore-legs,
and again in the reverse direction, to simulate birth. The ordinary
birth ceremonies are then gone through, and the father smells his son
as a cow smells her calf.</p>
<p>Tradition runs to the effect that, at the time of the separation of
R&#257;m&#275;svaram island from the mainland, the cows became
prisoners thereon. Not being able, like the cows of Cape Cod, which are
fed on herrings&rsquo; heads, to adapt themselves to a fish diet, they
became gradually converted into diminutive metamorphosed cows, which
may still be seen grazing on the shore. The legend is based on the
fancied resemblance of the horned coffer-fishes (<i>Ostracion
cornutus</i>), which are frequently caught by the fishermen, to cattle.
Portions of the skulls of cats and dogs, which are sometimes picked up
on the beach, also bear a rude resemblance to the skull of a cow, the
horns being represented by the zygoma.</p>
<p>A story is told at Cochin that the beautiful blue and white tiles
from Canton, which adorn the floor of the synagogue of the White Jews,
were originally intended for the Durbar hall of a former R&#257;ja of
Cochin. But a wily Jew declared that bullock&rsquo;s blood must have
been used in the preparation of the glaze, and offered to take
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>them off the hands of the R&#257;ja, who was only
too glad to get rid of them.</p>
<p>The afterbirths (placent&aelig;) of cattle are tied to a tree which
yields a milky juice, in the belief that the cow will thereby give a
better yield of milk.</p>
<p>There is a custom among the Tellis (Oriya oil-pressers) that, if a
cow dies with a rope round its neck, or on the spot where it is
tethered, the family is under pollution until purification has been
effected by means of a pilgrimage, or by bathing in a sacred river. The
Holodia section of the Tellis will not rear male calves, and do not
castrate their bulls. Male calves are disposed of by sale as speedily
as possible.</p>
<p>If the jungle Paliyans of Tinnevelly come across the carcase of a
cow or buffalo near a stream, they will not go near it for a long time.
They absolutely refuse to touch leather, and one of them declined to
carry my camera box, because he detected that it had a leather
strap.</p>
<p>The B&#257;kudas of South Canara will not carry a bedstead, unless
the legs are first taken off, and it is said that this objection rests
upon the supposed resemblances between the four-legged cot and the
four-legged ox. In like manner, the Koragas have a curious prejudice
against carrying any four-legged animal, dead or alive. This extends to
anything with four legs, such as a chair, table, etc., which they
cannot be prevailed on to lift, unless one leg is removed. As they work
as coolies, this is said sometimes to cause inconvenience.<a class=

<p>Among the Sembaliguda Gadabas of Vizagapatam, there is a belief that
a piece of wild buffalo horn, buried in the ground of the village, will
avert or cure cattle disease.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1512src" href=

<p>The jungle K&#257;dirs believe that their gods occasionally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>reside in the body of a &ldquo;bison&rdquo;
(<i>Bos gaurus</i>), and have been known to worship a bull shot by a
sportsman.</p>
<p>The goddess G&#257;ngad&#275;vi is worshipped by the K&#275;vutos
(fishing caste) of Ganjam at the Dasara festival, and goats are
sacrificed in her honour. In the neighbourhood of the Chilka lake, the
goats are not sacrificed, but set at liberty, and allowed to graze on
the K&#257;likad&#275;vi hill. There is a belief that animals thus
dedicated to the goddess do not putrify when they die, but dry up.</p>
<p>The Tiyans (toddy-drawers) of Malabar carry, tucked into the
waist-cloth, a bone loaded with lead at both ends, which is used for
tapping the flower-stalk of the palm tree to bring out the juice. A man
once refused to sell one of these bones to Mr F. Fawcett at any price,
as it was the femur of a s&#257;mbar (<i>Cervus unicolor</i>), which
possessed such virtue that it would fetch juice out of any tree.
Deer&rsquo;s horn, ground into a fine paste, is said to be an excellent
balm for pains and swellings. It is sometimes made into a powder, which
is mixed with milk or honey, and produces a potion which is supposed to
aid the growth of stunted women.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1529src"

<p>A Y&#257;n&#257;di shik&#257;ri (hunter) has been known, when
skinning a black buck (antelope) shot by a European, to cut out the
testicles, and wrap them up in his loin-cloth, to be subsequently taken
as an aphrodisiac. Antelope horn, when powdered and burnt, is said to
drive away mosquitoes, and keep scorpions away. A paste made with
antelope horn is used as an external application for sore throat.
Antelope and chink&#257;ra (Indian gazelle) horns, if kept in grain
baskets, are said to prevent weevils from attacking the grain.</p>
<p>The Gadabas of Vizagapatam will not touch a horse, as they are
palanquin-bearers, and have the same objection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>to the
rival animal that a cab-driver has to a motor-car. In South Canara,
none but the lowest Pariah will rub a horse down. If a Malai
Vell&#257;la of Coimbatore touches one of these animals, he has to
perform a religious ceremonial for the purpose of purification.</p>
<p>The members of the elephant sept of the Oriya Haddis, when they see
the foot-prints of an elephant, take some of the dust from the spot,
and make a mark on the forehead with it. They also draw the figure of
an elephant, and worship it, when they perform sr&#257;dh and other
ceremonies. Wild elephants are said to be held in veneration by the
jungle K&#257;dirs, whereas tame ones are believed to have lost the
divine element.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1542src" href="#xd26e1542"

<p>When cholera breaks out in a Kondh village, all males and females
smear their bodies from head to foot with pig&rsquo;s fat liquefied by
heat, and continue to do so until a few days after the disappearance of
the dread disease. During this time they do not bathe, lest the smell
of the fat should be washed away.</p>
<p>Some women rub the blood of the small garden-bat, which has
well-developed ears, into the artificially dilated lobes of their ears,
so as to strengthen them. The wings of bats are highly prized as a
hairwash. They are crushed, and mixed with cocoanut oil, and other
ingredients. The mixture is kept underground in a closed vessel for
three months, and then used to prevent the hair from falling out or
turning grey.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1549src" href="#xd26e1549"
name="xd26e1549src">17</a> The Paniyans of Malabar are said to eat
land-crabs for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>The common striped or palm-squirrel (<i>Sciurus palmarum</i>) was,
according to a legend, employed by R&#257;ma to assist the army of
monkeys in the construction of the bridge to connect
R&#257;m&#275;svaram island with Ceylon, whither R&#257;vana
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>had carried off his wife S&#299;ta. The squirrel
helped the monkeys by rolling in the sand on the shore, so as to
collect it in its hairy coat, and then depositing it between the piled
up stones, so as to cement them together. Seeing it fatigued by its
labours, R&#257;ma sympathetically stroked its back with the three
middle fingers of his right hand, marks of which still persist in the
squirrels at the present day. There is a further legend that, once upon
a time, one of the gods, having compassion on the toddy-drawers because
their life was a hard one, and because they were constantly exposed to
danger, left at the foot of a palmyra tree some charmed water, the
value of which was that it saved from injury any one falling from a
height. A toddy-drawer, however, got drunk, and, forgetting to drink
the elixir, went home. When he returned, he found that a squirrel had
drunk it, and vowed vengeance on it. And that is why every toddy-drawer
will always kill a squirrel, and also why the squirrel, from whatever
height it may fall, comes to no harm.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1561src" href="#xd26e1561" name="xd26e1561src">18</a> In a note

"noteref" id="xd26e1564src" href="#xd26e1564" name=
"xd26e1564src">19</a> a legend that the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns (Tamil
toddy-drawers) are descended from Adi, the daughter of a Pariah woman
at Karuvur, who taught them to climb the palm tree, and prepared a
medicine which would protect them from falling from the high trees. The
squirrels also ate some of it, and enjoy a similar immunity. There is a
Tamil proverb that, if you desire to climb trees, you must be a
Sh&#257;n&#257;n. The story was told by Bishop Caldwell of a
Sh&#257;n&#257;n who was sitting upon a leaf-stalk at the top of a
palmyra palm in a high wind, when the stalk gave way, and he came down
to the ground quite safely, sitting on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>leaf,
which served the purpose of a natural parachute. Woodpeckers are called
Sh&#257;n&#257;ra kurivi by bird-catchers, because they climb trees
like Sh&#257;n&#257;ns.</p>
<p>There is a legend that, before the K&#257;liy&#363;ga began, the
P&#257;ndavas lived on the N&#299;lgiris. A kind of edible truffle
(<i>Mylitta lapidescens</i>) is known as little man&rsquo;s bread on
these hills. The Badaga legendary name for it is
P&#257;ndva-unna-buthi, or dwarf bundle of food,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1577src" href="#xd26e1577" name="xd26e1577src">20</a>
<i>i.e.</i>, food of the dwarfs, who are supposed to have built the
p&#257;ndu k&#363;lis or kistvaens. Being so small, they called in the
black-naped hare (<i>Lepus nigricollis</i>) to plough their fields. The
black patches on their necks are the inherited mark of the yoke. The
blood of the hare is administered to children suffering from cough.</p>
<p>Br&#257;mans use a porcupine quill for parting their wives&rsquo;
hair in a ceremony connected with the period of gestation known as
s&#299;mantam. It is said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1588src" href=

N&#257;mb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans, the quill should have three white
marks on it. The quills of porcupines are sold by J&#333;gis (Telugu
mendicants) to goldsmiths, for use as brushes.</p>
<p>There is a tradition among the fishing folk of R&#257;m&#275;svaram
island that a box of money was once found in the stomach of a dugong
(<i>Halicore dugong</i>), and an official is consequently invited to be
present at the examination of the stomach contents, so that the
possessors of the carcase may not be punished under the Treasure Trove
Act for concealing treasure. The fat of the dugong is believed to be
efficacious in the treatment of dysentery, and is administered in the
form of sweetmeats, or used instead of gh&#299; (clarified butter) in

<p class="first">The following story is current concerning the sacred
vultures of Tirukazhukunram. The Ashtavasus, or eight gods who guard
the eight points of the compass, did penance, and Siva appeared in
person before them. But, becoming angry with them, he cursed them, and
turned them into vultures. When they asked for forgiveness, Siva
directed that they should remain at the temple of Vedagiri Iswara. One
pair of these birds still survives, and come to the temple daily at
noon for food. Two balls of rice cooked with gh&#299; (clarified
butter) and sugar, which have been previously offered to the deity, are
placed at a particular spot on the hill. The vultures, arriving
simultaneously, appropriate a ball apiece. The temple priests say that,
every day, one of the birds goes on a pilgrimage to Benares, and the
other to R&#257;m&#275;svaram. It is also said that the pair will never
come together, if sinners are present at the temple.</p>
<p>When a person is ill, his family sometimes make a vow that they will
ofter a few pounds of mutton to the Bra&#257;hmani kite (<i>Haliastur
indus</i>, Garuda pakshi) on the patient&rsquo;s recovery. It is
believed that, should the offering be acceptable, the sick person will
speedily get better, and the bird will come to demand its meat, making
its presence known by sitting on a tree near the house, and crying
plaintively. The shadow of a Bra&#257;hmani kite falling on a cobra is
said to stupefy the snake. The Kondhs do not consider it a sin to kill
this bird, which is held in veneration throughout Southern India. A
Kondh will kill it for so slight an offence as carrying off his
chickens.</p>

<p>The crow is believed to possess only one eye, which moves from
socket to socket as occasion demands. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>belief is founded on the
legend that an Asura, disguised as a crow, while R&#257;ma was sleeping
with his head on S&#299;ta&rsquo;s lap in the jungles of Dandaka,
pecked at her breasts, so that blood issued therefrom. On waking,
R&#257;ma, observing the blood, and learning the cause of it, clipped a
bit of straw, and, after infusing it with the Brahma astra (miraculous
weapon), let it go against the crow Asura, who appealed to R&#257;ma
for mercy. Taking pity on it, R&#257;ma told the Asura to offer one of
its eyes to the weapon, and saved it from death. Since that time, crows
are supposed to have only one eye. The Kondhs will not kill crows, as
this would be a sin amounting to the killing of a friend. According to
their legend, soon after the creation of the world, there was a family
consisting of an aged man and woman, and four children, who died one
after the other in quick succession. Their parents were too infirm to
take the necessary steps for their cremation, so they threw the bodies
away on the ground at some distance from their home. God appeared to
them in their dreams one night, and promised that he would create the
crow, so that it might devour the dead bodies. Some Koyis believe that
hell is the abode of an iron crow, which feeds on all who go there.
There is a legend in the Kavarathi Island of the Laccadives, that a
M&#257;ppilla tangal (Muhammadan priest) once cursed the crows for
dropping their excrement on his person, and now there is not a crow on
the island.</p>
<p>It is believed that, if a young crow-pheasant is tied by an iron
chain to a tree, the mother, as soon as she discovers the captive, will
go and fetch a certain root, and by its aid break the chain, which,
when it snaps, is converted into gold.</p>
<p>In some K&#257;pu (Telugu cultivator) houses, bundles of ears of
rice may be seen hung up as food for sparrows, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>which
are held in esteem. The hopping of sparrows is said to resemble the
gait of a person confined in fetters, and there is a legend that the
K&#257;pus were once in chains, and the sparrows set them at liberty,
and took the bondage on themselves. Native physicians prescribe the
flesh and bones of cock sparrows for those who have lost their
virility. The birds are cleaned, and put in a mortar, together with
other medicinal ingredients. They are pounded together for several
hours, so that the artificial heat produced by the operation converts
the mixture into a pulpy mass, which is taken in small doses. The flesh
of quails and partridges is also believed to possess remedial
properties.</p>
<p>A west coast housewife, when she buys a fowl, goes through a mystic
ritual to prevent it from getting lost. She takes it thrice round the
fireplace, saying to it: &ldquo;Roam over the country and the forest,
and come home safe again.&rdquo; Some years ago, a rumour spread
through the Koyi villages that an iron cock was abroad very early in
the morning, and upon the first village in which it heard one or more
cocks crow it would send a pestilence, and decimate the village. In one
instance, at least, this led to the immediate extermination of all the
cocks in the village.</p>
<p>The Indian roller (<i>Coracias indica</i>), commonly called the blue
jay, is known as p&#257;la-pitta or milk bird, because it is supposed
that, when a cow gives little milk, the yield will be increased if a
few of the feathers of this bird are chopped up, and given to it along
with grass.</p>
<p>The fat of the peacock, which moves gracefully and easily, is
supposed to cure stiff joints. Peacock&rsquo;s feathers are sold in the
bazaar, and the burnt ashes are used as a cure for vomiting.</p>
<p>The deposit of white magnesite in the &ldquo;Chalk Hills&rdquo; of
the Salem district is believed to consist of the bones <span class=

<p class="first">It is recorded by Canter Visscher<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1642src" href="#xd26e1642" name="xd26e1642src">22</a> that,
&ldquo;in the mountains and remote jungles of this country (Malabar),
there is a species of snake of the shape and thickness of the stem of a
tree, which can swallow men and beasts entire. I have been told an
amusing story about one of these snakes. It is said that at Barcelore a
chego (Chogan) had climbed up a cocoanut tree to draw toddy or palm
wine, and, as he was coming down, both his legs were seized by a snake
which had stretched itself up alongside the tree with its mouth wide
open, and was sucking him in gradually as he descended. Now, the
Indian, according to the custom of his country, had stuck his teifermes
(an instrument not unlike a pruning knife), into his girdle with the
curve turned outwards; and, when he was more than half swallowed, the
knife began to rip up the body of the snake so as to make an opening,
by which the lucky man was most unexpectedly able to escape. Though the
snakes in this country are so noxious to the natives, yet the ancient
veneration for them is still maintained. No one dares to injure them or
to drive them away by violence, and so audacious do they become that
they will sometimes creep between people&rsquo;s legs when they are
eating, and attack their bowls of rice, in which case retreat is
necessary until the monsters have satiated themselves, and taken their
departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another snake story, worthy of the Baron M&uuml;nchausen, is
recorded in Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Catalogue raisonn&eacute; of Oriental
Manuscripts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1647src" href=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Coya (Koyi) people eat snakes. About forty
years since a Br&#257;hman saw a person cooking snakes for food, and,
expressing great astonishment, was told by the forester that these were
mere worms; that, if he wished to see a serpent, one should be shown
him; but that, as for themselves, secured by the potent charms taught
them by Ambik&#275;svarer, they feared no serpents. As the Br&#257;hman
desired to see this large serpent, a child was sent with a bundle of
straw and a winnowing fan, who went, accompanied by the Br&#257;hman,
into the depths of the forest, and, putting the straw on the mouth of a
hole, commenced winnowing, when smoke of continually varying colours
arose, followed by bright flame, in the midst of which a monstrous
serpent having seven heads was seen. The Br&#257;hman was speechless
with terror at the sight, and, being conducted back by the child, was
dismissed with presents of fruits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is stated by Mr Gopal Panikkar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1657src" href="#xd26e1657" name="xd26e1657src">24</a> that,
&ldquo;people believe in the existence inside the earth of a precious
stone called manikkakkallu. These stones are supposed to have been made
out of the gold, which has existed in many parts of the earth from time
immemorial. Certain serpents of divine nature have been blowing for
ages on these treasures of gold, some of which dwindle into a small
stone of resplendent beauty and brightness called manikkam. The moment
their work is finished, the serpents are transformed into winged
serpents, and fly up into the air with the stones in their
mouths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to another version of this legend,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1662src" href="#xd26e1662" name="xd26e1662src">25</a>
&ldquo;people in Malabar believe that snakes guard treasure. But silver
they will have none. Even in the case of gold, the snakes are said to
visit hidden treasure for twelve years occasionally, and, only when
they find that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>treasure is not removed in the meantime, do
they begin to guard it. When once it has begun to watch, the snake is
said to be very zealous over it. It is said to hiss at it day and
night. This constant application is believed to diminish its
proportions, and to make it assume a smaller appearance. In time, in
the place of the pointed tail, the reptile is said to get wings, and
the treasure, by the continuous hissing, to assume the form of a
precious stone. When this is done, the snake is said to fly with its
precious acquisition. So strong is this belief that, when a comet
appeared some ten years ago, people firmly believed that it was the
flight of the winged serpent with the precious stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Natives, when seeking for treasure, arm themselves with a staff made
from one of the snake-wood trees, in the belief that the snakes which
guard the treasure will retire before it.</p>
<p>In Malabar, it is believed that snakes wed mortal girls, and fall in
love with women. When once they do so, they are said to be constantly
pursuing them, and never to leave them, except for an occasional
separation for food. The snake is said never to use its fangs against
its chosen woman. So strong is the belief, that women in Malabar would
think twice before attempting to go by themselves into a bush.<a class=

<p>There is a temple in Ganjam, the idol in which is said to be
protected from desecration at night by a cobra. When the doors are
being shut, the snake glides in, and coils itself round the lingam.
Early in the morning, when the priest opens the door, it glides away,
without attempting to harm any of the large number of spectators, who
never fail to assemble.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1682src" href=

<p>The town of N&#257;gercoil in Travancore derives its name from the
temple dedicated to the snake-god (n&#257;ga kovil), where many stone
images of snakes are deposited. There is a belief that snake-bite is
not fatal within a mile of the temple.</p>
<p>The safety with which snake-charmers handle cobras is said to be due
to the removal of a stone, which supplied their teeth with venom, from
under the tongue or behind the hood. This stone is highly prized as a
snake poison antidote. It is said to be not unlike a tamarind stone in
size, shape, and appearance; and is known to be genuine if, when it is
immersed in water, bubbles continue to rise from it, or if, when put
into the mouth, it gives a leap, and fixes itself to the palate. When
it is applied to the punctures made by the snake&rsquo;s poison fangs,
it is said to stick fast and extract the poison, falling off of itself
as soon as it is saturated. After the stone drops off, the poison which
it has absorbed is removed by placing it in a vessel of milk which
becomes darkened in colour. A specimen was submitted to Faraday, who
expressed his belief that it was a piece of charred bone, which had
been filled with blood, and then charred again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1692src" href="#xd26e1692" name="xd26e1692src">28</a></p>
<p>There is, in Malabar, a class of people called mantrav&#257;dis
(dealers in magical spells), who are believed to possess an hereditary
power of removing the effects of snake poison by repeating mantrams,
and performing certain rites. If a house is visited by snakes, they can
expel them by reciting such mantrams on three small pebbles, and
throwing them on to the roof. In cases of snake-bite, they recite
mantrams and wave a cock over the patient&rsquo;s body from the head
towards the feet. Sometimes a number of cocks have to be sacrificed
before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>the charm works. The patient is then taken to a
tank (pond) or well, and a number of pots of water are emptied over his
head, while the mantrav&#257;di utters mantrams. There are said to be
certain revengeful snakes, which, after they have bitten a person, coil
themselves round the branches of a tree, and render the efforts of the
mantrav&#257;di ineffective. In such a case, he, through the aid of
mantrams, sends ants and other insects to harass the snake, which comes
down from the tree, and sucks the poison from the punctures which it
has made.</p>
<p>In the early part of the last century, a certain Tanjore pill had a
reputation as a specific against the bite of mad dogs, and of the most
poisonous snakes.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1704src" href="#xd26e1704"
name="xd26e1704src">29</a></p>
<p>The following note on a reputed cure for snake poisoning, used by
the Odd&#275;s (navvies), was communicated to me by Mr Gustav
Haller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A young boy, who belonged to a gang of
Odd&#275;s, was catching rats, and put his hand into a bamboo bush,
when a cobra bit him, and clung to his finger when he was drawing his
hand out of the bush. I saw the dead snake, which was undoubtedly a
cobra. I was told that the boy was in a dying condition, when a man of
the same gang said that he would cure him. He applied a brown pill to
the wound, to which it stuck without being tied. The man dipped a root
into the water, and rubbed it on the lad&rsquo;s arm from the shoulder
downwards. The arm, which was benumbed, gradually became sensitive, and
at last the fingers could move, and the pill dropped off. The moist
root was rubbed on to the boy&rsquo;s tongue, and into the corner of
the eyes, before commencing operations. The man said that a used pill
is quite efficacious, but should be well washed to get rid of the
poison. In the manufacture of the pills, five leaves of a creeper are
dried, and ground to powder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>The pill must be inserted for nine
days between the bark and cambium of a margosa tree (<i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>) during the new moon, when the sap ascends.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creeper referred to is <i>Tinospora cordifolia</i> (gul
b&#275;l), and the roots are apparently those of the same climbing
shrub. There is a widespread belief that gul b&#275;l growing on a
margosa tree is more efficacious as a medicine than that which is found
on other kinds of trees.</p>
<p>In cases of snake-bite, the Dommara snake-charmers place over the
seat of the bite a black stone, which is said to be composed of various
drugs mixed together and burnt. It is said to drop off, as soon as it
has absorbed all the poison. It is then put into milk or water to
extract the poison, and the fluid is thrown away as being dangerous to
life if swallowed. The Mandulas (wandering medicine men) use as an
antidote against snake-bite a peculiar wood, of which a piece is torn
off, and eaten by the person bitten.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1727src" href="#xd26e1727" name="xd26e1727src">30</a> Among the
V&#299;ramushtis (professional mendicants), there is a subdivision
called N&#257;ga Mallika (<i>Rhinacanthus communis</i>), the roots of
which are believed to cure snake-bite. The jungle Paliyans of the Palni
hills are said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1736src" href="#xd26e1736"
name="xd26e1736src">31</a> to carry with them certain leaves, called
naru valli v&#275;r, which they believe to be a very efficient antidote
to snake-bite. As soon as one of them is bitten, he chews the leaves,
and also applies them to the punctures. The Kudumi medicine men of
Travancore claim to be able to cure snake-bite by the application of
certain leaves ground into a paste, and by exercising their magical
powers. The Telugu Tottiyans are noted for their power of curing
snake-bites by means of mystical incantations, and the original
inventor of this mode <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span>of treatment has been deified under the name
of P&#257;mbalamman.</p>
<p>The jungle Y&#257;n&#257;dis are fearless in catching cobras, which
they draw out of their holes without any fear of their fangs. They
claim to be under the protection of a charm, while so doing. A
correspondent writes that a cobra was in his grounds, and his servant
called in a Y&#257;n&#257;di to dislodge it. The man caught it alive,
and, before killing it, carefully removed the poison-sac with a knife,
and swallowed it as a protection against snake-bite.</p>
<p>The N&#257;y&#257;dis of Malabar, when engaged in catching rats in
their holes, wear round the wrist a snake-shaped metal ring, to render
them safe against snakes which may be concealed in the hole.</p>
<p>A treatment for cobra-bite is to take a chicken, and make a deep
incision into the beak at the basal end. The cut surface is applied to
the puncture made by the snake&rsquo;s fangs, which are opened up with
a knife. After a time the chicken dies, and, if the patient has not
come round, more chicken must be applied until he is out of danger. The
theory is that the poison is attracted by the blood of the chicken, and
enters it. The following treatment for cobra bite is said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1747src" href="#xd26e1747" name=
"xd26e1747src">32</a> to be in vogue in some places:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;As soon as a person has been bitten, a
snake-charmer is sent for, who allures the same or another cobra whose
fangs have not been drawn to the vicinity of the victim, and causes it
to bite him at as nearly as possible the same place as before. Should
this be fulfilled, the bitten man will as surely recover as the snake
will die. It is believed that, if a person should come across two
cobras together, they will give him no quarter. To avoid being pursued
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>by them, he takes to his heels, after throwing
behind some garment, on which the snakes expend their wrath. When they
have completed the work of destruction, the pieces to which the cloth
has been reduced, are gathered together, and preserved as a panacea for
future ills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fisherman, who is in doubt as to whether a water-snake which has
bitten him is poisonous or not, sometimes has resort to a simple
remedy. He dips his hands into the mud, and eats several handfuls
thereof.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1760src" href="#xd26e1760" name=
"xd26e1760src">33</a></p>
<p>The fragrant inflorescence of <i>Pandanus fascicularis</i> is
believed to harbour a tiny snake, which is more deadly than the cobra.
Incautious smelling of the flowers may, it is said, lead to death.</p>
<p>The earth-snake (<i>Typhlops braminus</i>) is known as the
ear-snake, because it is supposed to enter the ear of a sleeper, and
cause certain death.</p>
<p>The harmless tree-snake (<i>Dendrophis pictus</i>) is more dreaded
than the cobra. It is believed that, after biting a human being, it
ascends the nearest palmyra palm, where it waits until it sees the
smoke ascending from the funeral pyre of the victim. The only chance of
saving the life of a person who has been bitten is to have a mock
funeral, whereat a straw effigy is burnt. Seeing the smoke, the deluded
snake comes down from the tree, and the bitten person recovers.</p>
<p>The green tree-snake (<i>Dryophis mycterizans</i>) is said to have a
habit of striking at the eyes of people, to prevent which a rag is tied
round the head of the snake, when it is caught. Another, and more
curious belief is that a magical oil can be prepared from its dead
body. A tender cocoanut is opened at one end, and the body of the snake
is put into the cocoanut, which, after being closed, is buried in a
miry place, and allowed to remain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>there until the body decays, and
the water in the cocoanut becomes saturated with the products of
decomposition. When this has taken place, the water is taken out, and
used as oil for a lamp. When a person carries such a lamp lighted, his
body will appear to be covered all over by running green tree-snakes,
to the great dismay of all beholders.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1788src" href="#xd26e1788" name="xd26e1788src">34</a></p>
<p>For the following note on beliefs concerning the green tree-snake
(<i>Dryophis</i>), I am indebted to Dr N. Annandale. A recipe for
making a good curry, used by women who are bad cooks, is to take a
tree-snake, and draw it through the hands before beginning to make the
curry. To cure a headache, kill a tree-snake, and ram cotton seed and
castor-oil down its throat, until the whole body is full. Then bury it,
and allow the seeds to grow. Take the seeds of the plants that spring
up, and separate the cotton from the castor seeds. Ram them down the
throat of a second snake. Repeat the process on a third snake, and make
a wick from the cotton of the plant that grows out of its body, and oil
from the castor plants. If you light the wick in a lamp filled with the
oil, and take it outside at night, you will see the whole place alive
with green tree-snakes. Another way of performing the same experiment
is to bore a hole in a ripe cocoanut, put in a live tree-snake, and
stop the hole up. Then place the cocoanut beneath a cow in a cowshed
for forty days, so that it is exposed to the action of the cow&rsquo;s
urine. A lamp fed with oil made from the cocoanut will enable you to
see innumerable tree-snakes at night.</p>
<p>The bite of the sand-snake (<i>Eryx Johnii</i>) is believed to cause
leprosy and twisting of the hands and feet. An earth-snake, which lives
at Kodaik&#257;nal on the Palni <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>hills, is credited with giving
leprosy to any one whose skin it licks. In the treatment of leprosy, a
Russell&rsquo;s viper (<i>Vipera russellii</i>) is stuffed with rice,
and put in an earthen pot, the mouth of which is sealed with clay. The
pot is buried for forty days, and then exhumed. Chickens are fed with
the rice, and the patient is subsequently fed on the chickens. The fat
of the rat-snake (<i>Zamenis mucosus</i>) is used as an external
application in the treatment of leprosy. An old woman, during an
epidemic of cholera at Bezw&#257;da, used to inject the patients
hypodermically with an aqueous solution of cobra venom.</p>
<p>Mischievous children, and others, when they see two persons
quarrelling, rub the nails of the fingers of one hand against those of
the other, and repeat the words &ldquo;Mungoose and snake, bite,
bite,&rdquo; in the hope that thereby the quarrel will be intensified,
and grow more exciting from the spectator&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>When a friend was engaged in experiments on snake venom, some
Dommaras (jugglers) asked for permission to unbury the corpses of the
snakes and mungooses for the purpose of food.</p>
<p>If a snake becomes entangled in the net of a Bestha fisherman in
Mysore when it is first used, the net is rejected, and burnt or
otherwise disposed of.</p>
<p>There is a widespread belief among children in Malabar, that a
lizard (<i>Calotes versicolor</i>) sucks the blood of those whom it
looks at. As soon, therefore, as they catch sight of this creature,
they apply saliva to the navel, from which it is believed that the
blood is extracted.</p>
<p>A legend is recorded by Dr Annandale,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1825src" href="#xd26e1825" name="xd26e1825src">35</a> in
accordance with which every good Muhammadan should kill the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>blood-sucker (lizard), <i>Calotes gigas</i>, at
sight, because, when some fugitive Muhammadans were hiding from their
enemies in a well, one of these animals came and nodded its head in
their direction till their enemies saw them.</p>
<p>A similar legend about another lizard is described as existing in
Egypt. Dr Annandale further records that the Hindus and Muhammadans of
Ramn&#257;d in the Ramn&#257;d district regard the cham&aelig;leon
(<i>Cham&aelig;leon calcaratus</i>) as being possessed by an evil
spirit, and will not touch it, lest the spirit should enter their own
bodies. I have been told that the bite of a cham&aelig;leon is more
deadly than that of a cobra.</p>
<p>There is a popular belief that the bite of the Brahmini lizard
(<i>Mabuia carinata</i>), called aranai in Tamil, is poisonous, and
there is a saying that death is instantaneous if aranai bites. The same
belief exists in Ceylon, and Mr Arthur Willey informs me that deaths
attributed to the bite of this animal are recorded almost annually in
the official vital statistics. I have never heard of a case of
poisoning by the animal in question. There is a legend that,
&ldquo;when the cobra and the arana were created, poison was supplied
to them, to be sucked from a leaf. The arana sucked it wholesale,
leaving only the leaf smeared over with poison for the cobra to lap
poison from; thereby implying that the cobra is far less venomous than
the arana. Thus people greatly exaggerate the venomous character of the
arana.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1845src" href="#xd26e1845"
name="xd26e1845src">36</a></p>
<p>It has already been noted (p. 73) that, when Savara children are
emaciated from illness, offerings are made to monkeys. Blood-suckers
are also said to be propitiated, because they have filamentous bodies.
A blood-sucker <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>is captured, small toy arrows are tied round its
body, and a piece of cloth is tied round its head. Some drops of liquor
are then poured into its mouth, and it is set at liberty.</p>
<p>The Mar&#257;tha R&#257;jas of Sand&#363;r belong to a family called
Ghorpade, which name is said to have been earned by one of them scaling
a precipitous fort by clinging to an &ldquo;iguana&rdquo;
(<i>Varanus</i>), which was crawling up it. The flesh of the
&ldquo;iguana&rdquo; is supposed to be possessed of extraordinary
invigorating powers, and a meal off this animal is certain to restore
the powers of youth. Its bite is considered very dangerous, and it is
said that, when it has once closed its teeth on human flesh, it will
not reopen them, and the only remedy is to cut out the piece it has
bitten.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1858src" href="#xd26e1858" name=
"xd26e1858src">37</a> This animal and the crocodile are believed to
proceed from the eggs laid by one animal. They are laid and hatched
near water, and, of the animals which come out of them, some find their
way into the water, while others remain on land. The former become
crocodiles, and the latter &ldquo;iguanas.&rdquo; The flesh of the
crocodile is administered as a cure for whooping-cough.</p>
<p>It is popularly believed that, if a toad falls on a pregnant woman,
the child that is to be born will die soon after birth. The only remedy
is to capture the offending toad, and fry it in some medicinal oil,
which must be administered to the child in order to save it from
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1863src" href="#xd26e1863" name=

pool is crowded with mahseer (<i>Barbus tor</i>) of all sizes. These
are wonderfully tame, the bigger ones feeding fearlessly from
one&rsquo;s hand, and even allowing their backs to be stroked. They are
protected by the M&#257;dgole zamindars, who on several grounds
venerate all fish. Once, the story goes, a Brinj&#257;ri caught one,
and turned it into curry, whereon the king of the fish solemnly cursed
him, and he and all his pack-bullocks were turned into rocks, which may
be seen there to the present day. At Sivar&#257;tri, a festival occurs
at the little thatched shrine near by, the priest at which is a Bagata
(Telugu freshwater fisher), and part of the ritual consists in feeding
the sacred fish. The M&#257;dgole zamindars claim to be descended from
the rulers of Matsya D&#275;sa. They are installed on a stone throne
shaped like a fish, display a fish on their banners, and use a figure
of a fish as a signature. Some of their dependents wear ear-rings
shaped like a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tank at Coondapoor contained a species of fish locally known as
the flower-fish, which was especially reserved for the table of
T&#299;pu Sultan, being fat and full of blood.<a class="noteref" id=

fish at Tirupparankunram near Madura are said to have been sages in a
bygone age, and it is believed to be very meritorious to look at them.
They are said to appear on the surface of the water only if you call
out &ldquo;K&#257;si Visvan&#257;tha.&rdquo; But it is said that a
handful of peas thrown into the pool is more effective. The
Ambalakk&#257;rans (Tamil cultivators) admit that they are called
Valaiyans, but repudiate any connection with the caste of that name.
They explain the appellation by a story that, when Siva&rsquo;s ring
was swallowed by a fish in the Ganges, one of their ancestors invented
the first net (valai) made in the world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Some Natives will not eat the murrel fish (<i>Ophiocephalus
striatus</i>), owing to its resemblance to a snake. Some Hal&#275;paiks
(Canarese toddy-drawers) avoid eating a fish called Sriniv&#257;sa,
because they fancy that the streaks on the body bear a resemblance to
the Vaishnavite sectarian mark (n&#257;mam). Members of the Vamma
g&#333;tra of the Janappans (Telugu traders) abstain from eating the
bombadai fish, because, when some of their ancestors went to fetch
water in a marriage pot, they found a number of this fish in the water
collected in the pot.</p>
<p>When a new net is used for the first time by the Besthas of Mysore,
the first fish which is caught is cut, and the net is smeared with its
blood. One of the meshes of the net is burnt, after incense has been
thrown into the fire.</p>

have been earned by the community in the following manner. In remote
times, a certain Br&#257;hman came upon hidden treasure, but, to his
amazement, the contents appeared in his eyes to be all live scorpions.
Out of curiosity, he hung one of them outside his house. A little while
after, a woman of inferior caste, who was passing by the house, noticed
it to be gold, and, upon her questioning him about it, the Br&#257;hman
espoused her, and by her means was able to enjoy the treasure. He gave
a feast in honour of his acquisition of wealth. He was subsequently
outcasted for his m&eacute;salliance with the low caste female, while

nickname.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"

<p>It is commonly said that the scorpion has great reverence for the
name of Gan&#275;sa, because it is supposed that when, on seeing a
scorpion, one cries out &ldquo;Pilliyar annai&rdquo; (in the name of
Gan&#275;sa), the scorpion will suddenly stop; the truth of the matter
being that any loud noise arrests the movements of the animal.<a class=

<p>At the temple of Kolaramma at Kolar in Mysore, a pit under the
entrance is full of scorpions, and the customary offerings are silver
scorpions. The village goddess at Nangavaram in the Trichinopoly
district is called Satt&#257;ndi Amman, and her idol represents her in
the act of weaving a garland of scorpions. It is generally supposed
that no scorpion can live in this village, and that the sacred ashes
from Satt&#257;ndi Amman&rsquo;s shrine are a specific for scorpion
stings. People sometimes carry some of the ashes about with them, in
case they should be stung.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1913src" href=

The idol V&#299;rabudra is carried to a mantapam outside the town, and

large number of scorpions. Whilst the god is taking his rest, the
attendants catch these scorpions, and hold them in their hands without
being stung. As long as the god remains in the mantapam, the scorpions
do not sting, but, directly he leaves it, they resume their poisonous

remained anchored and dangling by their tails, whilst neither then nor
afterwards did he show the slightest sign of pain or inconvenience. The
immunity may possibly have been the result of innate idiosyncratic
peculiarity in the constitution of the performer, or more probably
represented the outcome of artificial exemption acquired at the expense
of repeated inoculations with the virus, and corresponding development
of its antitoxin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sweeper man, who had a mole on his back in shape somewhat
resembling a scorpion, believed himself to be immune against scorpion
sting, and would confidently insert the poison spine of a live scorpion
into his skin. In a letter to a medical officer, a Native wrote, that,
when a pregnant woman is stung by a scorpion, the child which is in the
womb at the time of such stinging, when delivered, does not suffer from
the sting of a scorpion, if ever it is stung during its lifetime. Some
families keep in their homes small pots called th&#275;lkodukku undi
(scorpion sting vessels), and occasionally drop therein a copper coin,
which is supposed to secure immunity against scorpion sting. The Sakuna
Pakshi mendicants of Vizagapatam have a remedy for scorpion sting in
the root of a plant called th&#275;lla visari (scorpion antidote),
which they carry about with them on their rounds. The root should be
collected on a new-moon day which falls on a Sunday. On that day, the
Sakuna Pakshi bathes, cuts off his loin-cloth, and goes stark-naked to
a selected spot, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>where he gathers the roots. If a supply
thereof is required, and the necessary combination of moon and day is
not forthcoming, the roots should be collected on a Sunday or
Wednesday. In cases of scorpion sting, Dommara medicine-men rub up
patent boluses with human milk or juice of the milk-hedge plant
(<i>Euphorbia Tirucalli</i>), and apply them to the parts. Among quaint
remedies for scorpion sting may be noted, sitting with an iron crowbar
in the mouth, and the application of chopped lizard over the puncture.
The excrement of lizards fed on scorpions, and the undigested food in
the stomach of a freshly killed goat, dried and reduced to powder, are
also believed to be effective remedies. There is a belief that
scorpions have the power of reviving, even after being completely
crushed into pulp. We are, therefore, warned not to rest secure till
the animal has actually been cremated.</p>
<p>The whip-scorpion <i>Thelyphonus</i> is believed to be venomous,
some Natives stating that it stings like a scorpion, others that it
ejects a slimy fluid which burns, and produces blisters. The caudal
flagellum of <i>Thelyphonus</i>, of course, possesses no poison
apparatus.</p>
<p>When the umbilical cord of a Kondh baby sloughs off, a spider is
burnt in the fire, and its ashes are placed in a cocoanut shell, mixed
with castor-oil, and applied by means of a fowl&rsquo;s feather to the
navel.</p>
<p>The eggs of red ants, boiled in margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>)
oil, are said to be an invaluable remedy for children suffering from
asthma.</p>
<p>If a house is infested by mosquitoes, or the furniture and bedding
by bugs, the names of a hundred villages or towns should be written on
a piece of paper. Care must be taken that all the names end in uru,
k&#333;ttai, palayam, etc. The paper is fastened to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>ceiling or bed-post, and relief from the pests
will be instantaneous.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1950src" href=
"#xd26e1950" name="xd26e1950src">46</a></p>
<p>The Oriya Haddis, on the evening of the tenth day after a death,
proceed to some distance from the house, and place food and fruits on a
cloth spread on the ground. They then call the dead man by his name,
and eagerly wait till some insect settles on the cloth. As soon as this
happens, the cloth is folded up, carried home, and shaken over the
floor close to the spot where the household gods are kept, so that the
insect falls on the sand spread on the floor. A light is then placed on
the sanded floor, and covered with a new pot. After some time, the pot
is removed, and the sand examined for any marks which may be left on
it.</p>
<p>A devil, in the disguise of a dung-beetle of large size, is believed
to haunt the house wherein a baby has been newly born, and the impact
of the insect against the infant will bring about its instant
death.</p>
<p>The following case was brought to my notice by the Chemical Examiner
to Government. In Malabar, a young man, apparently in good health,
walked home with two other men after a feast, chewing betel. Arriving
at his home, he retired to rest, and was found dead in the morning.
Blood was described as oozing out of his eyes. It was given out that
the cause of death was an insect, which infests betel leaves, and is
very poisonous. The belief in death from chewing or swallowing the
veththilai or vettila poochi (betel insect) is a very general one, and
is so strong that, when a person suffers from giddiness, after chewing
betel, he is afraid that he has partaken of the poisonous insect.
Native gentlemen take particular care to examine every betel leaf, wipe
it with a cloth, and smear chunam (lime) over it, before chewing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>The poochi is called by Gundert<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1964src" href="#xd26e1964" name=
"xd26e1964src">47</a> vettila p&#257;mpu or moorkhan (snake), or
vettila th&#275;l (scorpion). It has been described<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1967src" href="#xd26e1967" name="xd26e1967src">48</a> as
&ldquo;a poisonous creature, which lives adhering to the betel leaf.
Its presence cannot be easily detected, and many deaths occur among
persons who are in the habit of carelessly chewing betel. The poison
passes into the system through the moisture of the mouth, and death
ensues within an hour and a half. It generally inhabits the female
leaf, <i>i.e.</i>, the leaf that opens at night. The following symptoms
are seen when a person is affected with the poison:&mdash;exhaustion,
delirium, copious perspiration, and change of colour of the skin.
Treatment:&mdash;administer internally the juice of the leaves of a
tree called aripp&#275;ra. Make the patient suck the milk of the breast
of a woman, whose baby is more than eighty days old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A perich&aelig;te earthworm was sent to me from Malabar as a
specimen of vettila poochi, with a note to the effect that, when it is
accidentally chewed, the chief symptom is drawing in of the tongue, and
consequent death from suffocation. The antidote was said to be salt and
water, and the leaves of the goa (guava) tree. From South Canara, Mr H.
Latham sent me a planarian worm, about two inches in length, which is
believed to be the vettila poochi. His camp boy told him of a case in
which death was said to have resulted from eating one of these animals
cooked with some jak fruit.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a scare arose in connection with an insect, which
was said to have taken up its abode in imported German glass bangles,
which compete with the indigenous industry of the G&#257;zula
bangle-makers. The insect was reported to lie low in the bangle till it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>was purchased, when it would come out and nip
the wearer, after warning her to get her affairs in order before
succumbing. A specimen of a broken bangle, from which the insect was
said to have burst forth, was sent to me. But the insect was not
forthcoming.</p>
<p>As a further example of the way in which the opponents of a new
industry avail themselves of the credulity of the Native, I may cite
the recent official introduction of the chrome-tanning industry in
Madras. In connection therewith, a rumour spread more or less
throughout the Presidency that the wearing of chrome-tanned boots or
sandals gave rise to leprosy, blood poisoning, and failure of the
eyesight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=

<p class="first">The objection which a high caste Br&#257;hman has to
being seen by a low caste man when he is eating his food is based on a
belief allied to that of the evil eye. The Br&#257;hmanical theory of
vision, as propounded in the sacred writings, and understood by
orthodox pandits, corresponds with the old corpuscular theory. The low
caste man being in every respect inferior to the Br&#257;hman, the
matter or subtle substance proceeding from his eye, and mixing with the
objects seen by him, must of necessity be inferior and bad. So food,
which is seen by a low caste man, in virtue of the <i>radii
perniciosi</i> which it has received, will contaminate the
Br&#257;hman. This, it has been pointed out,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1992src" href="#xd26e1992" name="xd26e1992src">1</a> is &ldquo;a
good illustration of the theory propounded by Mr E. S. Hartland at the

religion, in their earliest forms, are based on the conception of a

<p>A friend once rode accidentally into a weaver&rsquo;s feast, and
threw his shadow on their food, and trouble arose in consequence. On
one occasion, when I was in camp at Coimbatore, the Odd&#275;s
(navvies) being afraid of my evil eye, refused to fire a new kiln of
bricks for the new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>club chambers, until I had taken my
departure. On another occasion, I caught hold of a ladle, to show my
friend Dr Rivers what were the fragrant contents of a pot, in which an
Odd&#275; woman was cooking the evening meal. On returning from a walk,
we heard a great noise proceeding from the Odd&#275; men who had
meanwhile returned from work, and found the woman seated apart on a
rock, and sobbing. She had been excommunicated, not because I touched
the ladle, but because she had afterwards touched the pot. After much
arbitration, I paid up the necessary fine, and she was received back
into her caste.</p>
<p>The following passage occurred in an official document, which was
sent to Sir M. E. Grant Duff, when he was Governor of Madras.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2003src" href="#xd26e2003" name="xd26e2003src">2</a>
The writer was Mr Andrew, C.S.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Sir C. Trevelyan visited Walajapet many years
ago. When there, he naturally asked to see the cloths, carpets, etc.
(which are manufactured there). Soon after (owing to the railway of
course), trade began to diminish, and to this day, I hear that even the
well-to-do traders think it was owing to the visit, as they believe
that, if a great man takes particular notice of a person or place,
ill-luck will follow. A month ago, I was walking near Ranipet, and
stopped for a minute to notice a good native house, and asked whose it
was, etc. A few hours after, the house took fire (the owner, after his
prayers upstairs, had left a light in his room), and the people in the
town think that the fire was caused by my having noticed the house. So,
when His Excellency drove through Walajapet last July, the bazaar
people did not show their best cloths, fearing ill-luck would follow,
but also because they thought he would introduce their trade in
carpets, etc., into the Central Jail, Vellore, and so ruin
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In villages, strangers are not allowed to be present, when the cows
are milked. Sudden failure of milk, or blood-stained milk, are
attributed to the evil eye, to remove the influence of which the owner
of the affected cow resorts to the magician. When the hill Kondhs are
threshing the crop, strangers may not look on the crop, or speak to
them, lest their evil eye should be cast on them. If a stranger is seen
approaching the threshing-floor, the Kondhs keep him off by signalling
with their hands, without speaking.</p>
<p>In Malabar, a mantram, which is said to be effective against the
potency of the evil eye, runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Salutation to
thee, O God! Even as the moon wanes in its brightness at the sight of
the sun, even as the bird chakora (crow-pheasant) disappears at the
sight of the moon, even as the great Vasuki (king of serpents) vanishes
at the sight of the chakora, even as the poison vanishes from his head,
so may the potency of his evil eye vanish with thy aid.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2015src" href="#xd26e2015" name="xd26e2015src">3</a>
In Malabar, fear of the evil eye is very general. At the corner of the
upper storey of almost every N&#257;yar house near a road or path is
suspended some object, often a doll-like hideous creature, on which the
eye of the passers-by may rest.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2018src"

position an image, sometimes of extreme indecency, a pot covered with
cabalistic signs, a prickly branch of cactus, or what not, to catch the
evil eye of passers-by, and divert their attention from the important
work in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the carved wooden images recall forcibly to mind the
Horatian satire:&mdash;&ldquo;Olim truncus eram&#8202;&hellip;.

<p>For the following note on the evil eye in Malabar, I am indebted to
Mr S. Appadorai Iyer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is not the eye alone that commits the
mischief, but also the mind and tongue. Man is said to do good or evil
through the mind, word and deed, <i>i.e.</i>, manasa, v&#257;cha, and
karmana. When a new house is being constructed, or a vegetable garden
or rice-field are in a flourishing condition, the following precautions
are taken to ward off the evil eye:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) <span class="sc">In Buildings</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;1. A pot with black and white marks on it is suspended mouth
downwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. A wooden figure of a monkey, with pendulous testicles, is
suspended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. The figure of a Malay&#257;li woman, with protuberant
breasts, is suspended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) <span class="sc">In Gardens and Fields</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;1. A straw figure, covered with black cloth daubed with black
and white dots, is placed on a long pole. If the figure represents a
male, it has pendent testicles, and, if a female, well developed
breasts. Sometimes, male and female figures are placed together in an
embracing posture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;2. Pots, as described above, are placed on bamboo poles.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;3. A portion of the skull of a bull, with horns attached, is
set up on a long pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The figures, pots, and skulls, are primarily intended to
scare away crows, stray cattle, and other marauders, and secondly to
ward off the evil eye. Instances are quoted, in which handsome
buildings have fallen down, and ripe fruits and grain crops have
withered through the influence of the eye, which has also been held
responsible for the bursting of a woman&rsquo;s breasts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Madras, human figures, made of broken bricks and mortar, are kept
permanently in the front of the upstairs verandah. Some years ago, Sir
George Birdwood recorded the flogging, by order of the Police
Magistrate of Black Town (now George Town), Madras, of a Hindu boy for
exhibiting an indecent figure in public view. What he had explicitly
done was to set up, in accordance with universal custom, a phallic
image before a house that was in course of erection by a Hindu
gentleman, who was first tried under the indictment, but was acquitted,
he, the owner, not having been the person who had actually exhibited
the image.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2090src" href="#xd26e2090" name=
"xd26e2090src">6</a></p>
<p>Monstrous Priapi, made in straw, with painted clay pots for heads,
pots smeared with chunam (lime) and studded with black dots, or palmyra
palm fruits coated with chunam, may often be seen set up in the fields,
to guard the ripening crop. In a note on the Tamil Paraiyans, the Rev
A. C. Clayton writes as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2098src"
href="#xd26e2098" name="xd26e2098src">7</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Charms, in the form of metal cylinders, are
worn to avoid the baneful influence of the evil eye. To prevent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>this from affecting the crops, Paraiyans put up
scarecrows in their fields. These are usually small broken earthen
pots, whitewashed or covered with spots of whitewash, or even adorned
with huge clay noses and ears, and made into grotesque faces. For the
same reason, more elaborate figures, made of mud and twigs in human
shape, are sometimes set up.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The indecent figures carved on temple cars, are intended to avert
the evil eye. During temple or marriage processions, two huge human
figures, male and female, made of bamboo wicker-work, are carried in
front for the same purpose. At the buffalo races in South Canara, which
take place when the first crop has been gathered, there is a
procession, which is sometimes headed by two dolls represented <i>in
coitu</i> borne on a man&rsquo;s head. At a race meeting near
Mangalore, one of the devil-dancers had the genitalia represented by a
long piece of cloth and enormous testicles.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in case of illness, a figure is made of rice-flour paste,
and copper coins are stuck on the head, hands, and abdomen thereof. It
is waved in front of the sick person, taken to a place where three
roads or paths meet, and left there. At other times, a hole is made in
a gourd (<i>Benincasa cerifera</i> or <i>Lagenaria vulgaris</i>), which
is filled with turmeric and chunam, and waved round the patient. It is
then taken to a place where three roads meet, and broken.</p>

<p>At a ceremony performed in Travancore when epidemic disease
prevails, an image of Bhadrak&#257;li is drawn on the ground with
powders of five colours, white, yellow, black, green, and red. At
night, songs are sung in praise of that deity by a T&#299;yattunni and
his followers. A member of the troupe then plays the part of
Bhadrak&#257;li in the act of murdering the demon Darika, and, in
conclusion, waves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span>a torch before the inmates of the house, to
ward off the evil eye, which is the most important item in the whole
ceremony. The torch is believed to be given by Siva, who is worshipped
before the light is waved.</p>
<p>In cases of smallpox, a bunch of n&#299;m (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>)
is sometimes moved from the head to the feet of the sick person, with
certain incantations, and then twisted and thrown away.</p>
<p>The sudden illness of children is often attributed to the evil eye.
In such cases, the following remedies are considered
efficacious:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) A few sticks from a new unused broom are set fire to, waved
several times round the child, and placed in a corner. With some of the
ashes the mother makes a mark on the child&rsquo;s forehead. If the
broom burns to ashes without making a noise, the women cry: &ldquo;Look
at it. It burns without the slightest noise. The creature&rsquo;s eyes
are really very bad.&rdquo; Abuse is then heaped on the person whose
eyes are supposed to have an evil influence.</p>
<p>(2) Some chillies, salt, human hair, nail-cuttings, and finely
powered earth from the pit of the door-post are mixed together, waved
three times in front of the child, and thrown onto the fire. Woe betide
the possessor of the evil eye, if no pungent, suffocating smell arises
when it is burning.</p>
<p>(3) A piece of burning camphor is waved in front of the child.</p>
<p>(4) Balls of cooked rice, painted red, black, and white (with
curds), are waved before the child.</p>
<p>Loss of appetite in children is attributed by mothers to the visit
of a supposed evil person to the house. On that person appearing again,
the mother will take a little sand or dust from under the
visitor&rsquo;s foot, whirl it round the head of the child, and throw
it on the hearth. If the suspected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>person is not likely to turn
up again, a handful of cotton-seed, chillies, and dust from the middle
of the street, is whirled round the child&rsquo;s head, and thrown on
the hearth. If the chillies produce a strong smell, the evil eye has
been averted. If they do not do so, the suspect is roundly abused by
the mother, and never again admitted to the house.</p>
<p>Matrons make the faces of children ugly by painting two or three
black dots on the chin and cheeks, and painting the eyelids black with
lamp-black paste. It is a good thing to frighten any one who expresses
admiration of one&rsquo;s belongings. For example, if a friend praises
your son&rsquo;s eyes, you should say to him, &ldquo;Look out! There is
a snake at your feet.&rdquo; If he is frightened, the evil eye has been
averted. It is said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2156src" href=
"#xd26e2156" name="xd26e2156src">8</a> that &ldquo;you will cause
mortal offence to a Hindu lady, should you remark of her child
&lsquo;What a nice baby you have,&rsquo; or &lsquo;How baby has grown
since I saw him last.&rsquo; She makes it a rule to speak deprecatingly
of her child, and represents it as the victim of non-existent ailments,
so that your evil eye shall not affect it. But, should she become aware
that, in spite of her precautions, you have defiled it with your
admiration, she will lose no time in counteracting the effect of
drishtidosham. One of the simplest methods adopted for this purpose is
to take a small quantity of chillies and salt in the closed palm, and
throw it into the fire, after waving it thrice round the head of the
child, to the accompaniment of incantations. If no pungent odour is
apparent, it is an indication that the dosham has been
averted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Sakalathi festival of the Badagas of the N&#299;lgiris, a
cake is made, on which are placed a little rice and butter. Three wicks
steeped in castor-oil are put in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117"
href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>it, and lighted. The cake is
then waved round the heads of all the children of the house, taken to a
field, and thrown thereon with the words &ldquo;Sakalathi has
come.&rdquo; At the S&#363;ppidi ceremony, which every
N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chetti (Tamil banker) youth has to perform before
marriage, the young man goes to the temple. On his return home, and at
the entrance of N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai houses which he passes,
rice-lamps are waved before him.</p>
<p>The custom of making a &ldquo;wave offering&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2167src" href="#xd26e2167" name="xd26e2167src">9</a> at
puberty and marriage ceremonies is very widespread. Thus, when a
Tangal&#257;n Paraiyan girl attains puberty, she is bathed on the ninth
day, and ten small lamps of flour paste, called drishti m&#257;vu
vilakku, are put on a sieve, and waved before her. Then coloured water
(&#257;rati or &#257;l&#257;m,) and burning camphor, are waved in front
of her. At the puberty ceremonies of the Tamil Maravans, the girl comes
out of seclusion on the sixteenth day, bathes, and returns to her
house. At the threshold, her future husband&rsquo;s sister is standing,
and averts the evil eye by waving betel leaves, plantains, cooked flour
paste, a vessel filled with water, and an iron measure containing rice
with a style stuck in it.</p>
<p>At a Palli (Tamil cultivator) wedding, water coloured with turmeric
and chunam (&#257;rati) is waved round the bride and bridegroom. Later
on, when the bride is about to enter the home of the bridegroom,
coloured water and a cocoanut are waved in front of the newly married
couple. At a marriage among the Pallans (Tamil cultivators), when the
contracting couple sit on the dais, coloured water, or balls of
coloured rice with lighted wicks, are waved round them. Water is poured
into their hands from a vessel, and sprinkled over their heads. The
vessel is then waved before them. During a K&#333;liyan <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>(Tamil weaver) wedding coloured water, into
which leaves of <i>Bauhinia variegata</i> are thrown, are waved. At a
marriage among the Khatris (weavers), when the bridegroom arrives at
the house of the bride, her mother comes out, and waves coloured water,
and washes his eyes with water. At a Tangal&#257;n Paraiyan wedding,
during a ceremony for removing the evil eye, a p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus
religiosa</i>) leaf is held over the foreheads of the bridal couple,
with its tail downwards, and all the close relations pour milk over it,
so that it trickles over their faces. During a marriage among the
Sembadavans (Tamil fishermen), the bride and bridegroom go through a
ceremony called sige kazhippu, with the object of warding off the evil
eye, which consists in pouring a few drops of milk on their foreheads
from a fig or betel leaf. At a K&#257;pu (Telugu cultivator) wedding,
the Ganga idol, which is kept in the custody of a Ts&#257;kala
(washerman), is brought to the marriage house. At the entrance thereto,
red-coloured food, coloured water, and incense, are waved before it.
During a marriage among the Balijas (Telugu traders), the bridegroom is
stopped at the entrance to the room in which the marriage pots are kept
by a number of married women, and has to pay a small sum for the
&#257;rati (coloured water), which is waved by the women. At a
Bilimagga (weaver) wedding in South Canara, the bridegroom&rsquo;s
father waves incense in front of a cot and brass vessel, and lights and
&#257;rati water are waved before the bridegroom.</p>
<p>At a royal marriage in Travancore, in 1906, a bevy of N&#257;yar
maidens, quaintly dressed, walked in front of the R&#257;ni&rsquo;s
palanquin. They were intended as Drishti Pariharam, to ward off the
evil eye.</p>

</div>
<p>Sometimes, in Malabar, when a person is believed to be under the
influence of a devil or the evil eye, salt, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>chillies, tamarinds, oil, mustard, cocoanut, and
a few pice (copper coins), are placed in a vessel, waved round the head
of the affected individual, and given to a N&#257;y&#257;di,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2193src" href="#xd26e2193" name=
"xd26e2193src">10</a> whose curse is asked for. There is this
peculiarity about a N&#257;y&#257;di&rsquo;s curse, that it always has
the opposite effect. Hence, when he is asked to curse one who has given
him alms, he complies by invoking misery and evil upon him. The terms
used by him for such invocations are attupo or mutinjupo (to perish),
adimondupo (to be a slave), etc.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2196src"
href="#xd26e2196" name="xd26e2196src">11</a></p>
<p>During one of my tours, a gang of Yerukalas absolutely refused to
sit on a chair, and I had perforce to measure their heads while they
squatted on the ground. To get rid of my evil influence, they
subsequently went through the ceremony of waving red-coloured water and
sacrificing fowls.</p>
<p>During a marriage among the M&#257;digas (Telugu Pariahs), a sheep
or goat is sacrificed to the marriage pots. The sacrificer dips his
hand in the blood of the animal, and impresses the blood on his palms
on the wall near the door leading to the room in which the pots are
kept. This is said to avert the evil eye. Among the Telugu M&#257;las,
a few days before a wedding, two marks are made, one on each side of
the door, with oil and charcoal, for the same purpose. At Kad&#363;r,
in the Mysore Province, I once saw impressions of the hand on the walls
of Br&#257;hman houses. Impressions in red paint of a hand with
outspread fingers may be seen on the walls of mosques and Muhammadan
buildings.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2203src" href="#xd26e2203" name=
"xd26e2203src">12</a></p>
<p>When cholera, or other epidemic disease, breaks out, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>Muhammadans leave the imprint of the hand dipped
in sandal paste on the door. When a Tamil Paraiyan dies, an impression
of the dead man&rsquo;s palm is sometimes taken in cow-dung, and stuck
on the wall.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2213src" href="#xd26e2213"

<p>The failure of a criminal expedition of the Koravas is said by Mr F.
Fawcett,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2218src" href="#xd26e2218" name=
"xd26e2218src">14</a> to be &ldquo;generally attributed to the evil
eye, or the evil tongue, whose bad effects are evinced in many ways. If
the excursion has been for house-breaking, the house-breaking implement
is often soldered at its sharp end with panchalokam (five metals), to
counteract the effect of the evil eye. The evil tongue is a frequent
cause of failure. It consists in talking evil of others, or harping on
probable misfortunes. There are various ways of removing its unhappy
effects. A mud figure of a man is made on the ground, and thorns are
placed over the mouth. This is the man with the evil tongue. Those who
have suffered walk round it, crying out and beating their mouths; the
greater the noise, the better the effect. Cutting the neck of a fowl
half through and allowing it to flutter about, or inserting a red hot
splinter in its anus to madden it with pain, are considered to be
effective, while, if a cock should crow after its neck has been cut,
calamities are averted.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"

<p class="first">Very closely connected with the subject of vows and
votive offerings is that of the worship of snakes, to which vows are
made and offerings dedicated.</p>
<p>In a note on serpent worship in Malabar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2231src" href="#xd26e2231" name="xd26e2231src">1</a> it is stated
that &ldquo;even to-day some corner of the garden of every respectable
tarawad<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2236src" href="#xd26e2236" name=
"xd26e2236src">2</a> is allotted for snakes. Here a few trees are
allowed to grow wild, and under them, on a masonry platform, one or
more sculptured granite stones representing hooded serpents (cobras)
are consecrated and set up. The whole area is held sacred, and a mud
lamp is lighted there every evening with religious regularity. I have
seen eggs, milk, and plantains offered in the evening, after the lamp
has been lit, at these shrines, to invoke the serpent&rsquo;s aid on
particular occasions. Such is the veneration in which these shrines are
held that Cherumars (agrestic serfs) and other low caste aborigines,
who are believed to pollute by their very approach, are absolutely
interdicted from getting within the precincts. Should, however, any
such pollute the shrine, the resident snake or its emissary is said to
apprise the owner of the defilement by creeping to the very threshold
of his house, and remaining there until the Karanavan,<a class=

it duly purified by a Br&#257;hman.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Concerning snake worship in Malabar, Mr C. Karunakara
Menon writes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2247src" href="#xd26e2247"
name="xd26e2247src">4</a> as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existence of snake groves is said to owe its origin to
Sr&#299; Parasur&#257;ma. [According to tradition, Parasur&#257;ma was
an avatar of Vishnu, who destroyed the Kshatriya R&#257;jas, and
retired to Gokarnam in Canara. He called on Varuna, the god of water,
to give him some land. Varuna caused the sea to recede, and thus the
land called K&#275;rala (including Malabar) came into existence.
Br&#257;hmans were brought from Northern India to colonise the new
country, but they ran away from fear of the snakes, of which it was
full. Parasur&#257;ma then brought in a further consignment of
Br&#257;hmans from the north, and divided the country into sixty-four
Br&#257;hmanical colonies.] Parasur&#257;ma advised that a part of
every house should be set apart for snakes as household gods. The
(snake) groves have the appearance of miniature reserved forests, as
they are considered sacred, and there is a strong prejudice against
cutting down trees therein. The groves contain a snake king and queen
made of granite, and a tower-like structure, made of laterite,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2255src" href="#xd26e2255" name="xd26e2255src">5</a>
for the sacred snakes. Snakes were, in olden days, considered a part of
the property. [Transfer deeds made special mention of the family
serpent as one of the articles sold along with the freehold.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a snake is seen inside, or in the neighbourhood of the
house, great care is taken to catch it without giving it the least
pain. Usually a stick is placed gently on its head, and the mouth of an
earthenware pot is shown to it. When it is in, the pot is loosely
covered with a cocoanut shell, to allow of free breathing. It is then
taken to a secluded spot, the pot is destroyed, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>snake set at liberty. It is considered to be
polluted by being caught in this way, and holy water is sometimes
poured over it. Killing a snake is considered a grievous sin, and even
to see a snake with its head bruised is believed to be a precursor of
calamities. Pious Malay&#257;lis (natives of Malabar), when they see a
snake killed in this way, have it burnt with the full solemnities
attendant on the cremation of a high-caste Hindu. The carcase is
covered with a piece of silk, and burnt in sandalwood. A Br&#257;hman
is hired to observe pollution for some days, and elaborate funeral
oblations are offered to the dead snake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Travancore there was formerly a judicial ordeal by snake-bite.
The accused thrust his hand into a mantle, in which a cobra was wrapped
up. If it bit him, he was declared guilty, if not innocent.</p>
<p>In connection with snake worship in Malabar, Mr Upendra Pai gives
the following details.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2267src" href=
"#xd26e2267" name="xd26e2267src">6</a> Among snakes none is more
dreaded than the cobra (<i>Naia tripudians</i>), which accordingly has
gathered round it more fanciful superstitions than any other snake.
This has led to cobra worship, which is often performed with a special
object in view. In some parts of the country, every town or village has
its images of cobras rudely carved on stone. These cobra stones, as
they are termed, are placed either on little platforms of stone
specially erected for them, or at the base of some tree, preferably a
holy fig.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2275src" href="#xd26e2275" name=
"xd26e2275src">7</a> On the fifth day of the lunar month Shravana,
known as the N&#257;garapanchami&mdash;that is, the fifth day of the
n&#257;gas or serpents&mdash;these stones are first washed;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>then milk, curds, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2283" title="Source: ghee">gh&#299;</span> (clarified butter),
and cocoanut water, are poured over them. Afterwards they are decorated
with flowers, and offerings are made to them. The cobra stone is also
worshipped at other times by those who have no male children, in order
to obtain such. But to establish new images of cobras in suitable
places is regarded as a surer method of achieving this object. For this
certain preliminary ceremonies have to be gone through, and, when once
the image has been established, it is the duty of the establisher to
see that it is properly worshipped at least once a year, on the
N&#257;garapanchami day. The merit obtained is proportionate to the
number of images thus worshipped, so that pious people, to obtain a
great deal of merit, and at the same time to save themselves the
expense of erecting many stone images, have several images drawn, each
on a tiny bit of a thin plate of gold or silver. These images are
handed over to some priest, to be kept along with other images, to
which daily worship is rendered. In this way, great merit is supposed
to be obtained. It is also believed that such worship will destroy all
danger proceeding from snakes. The cobra being thus an object of
worship, it is a deadly sin to kill or maim it. For the cobra is in the
popular imagination a Br&#257;hman, and there is no greater sin than
that of killing a Br&#257;hman. Accordingly, if any one kills a cobra,
he is sure to contract leprosy, which is the peculiar punishment of
those who have either killed a cobra, or have led to the destruction of
its eggs by digging in or ploughing up soil which it haunts, or setting
on fire jungle or grass in the midst of which it is known to live and
breed.</p>

<p>In a note on snake worship, Mr R. Kulathu Iyer writes as
follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2295src" href="#xd26e2295" name=
"xd26e2295src">8</a>&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In Travancore there is a place called
Mannarsala, which is well known for its serpent worship. It is the
abode of the snake king and queen, and their followers. The grove and
its premises cover about 16 acres. In the middle of this grove are two
small temples dedicated to the snake king and queen. There are also
thousands of snakes of granite, representing the various followers of
the king and queen. Just to the northern side of the temple there is a
house, the abode of the Nampiathy,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2304src"
href="#xd26e2304" name="xd26e2304src">9</a> who performs pooja
(worship) in the temple. In caste he is lower in grade than a
Br&#257;hmin. The temple has paddy (rice) fields and estates of its
own, and also has a large income from various sources. There is an
annual festival at this temple, known as Ayilyam festival, which is
celebrated in the months of Kanny and Thulam (September and October). A
large number of people assemble for worship with offerings of gold,
silver, salt, melons, etc. The sale proceeds of these offerings after a
festival would amount to a pretty large sum. On the day previous to the
Ayilyam festival, the temple authorities spend something like three
thousand rupees in feeding the Br&#257;hmins. A grand feast is given to
nearly three thousand Br&#257;hmins at the house of the Nampiathy. On
the Ayilyam day, all the serpent gods are taken in procession to the
illam (house of the Nampiathy) by the eldest female member of the
house, and offerings of neerumpalum (a mixture of rice-flour, turmeric,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2307" title="Source: ghee">gh&#299;</span>,
water of tender cocoanuts, etc.), boiled rice, and other things, are
made to the serpent gods. It is said that the neerumpalum mixture would
be poured into a big vessel, and kept inside a room for three days,
when the vessel would be found empty. It is supposed that the serpents
drink the contents. As regards the origin of this celebrated grove, Mr
S. Krishna Iyer, in one of his contributions to the <i>Calcutta
Quarterly Review</i>, says that &lsquo;the land from Avoor on the south
to Alleppy on the north was the site of the Khandava forest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>celebrated in the Mahabaratha; that, when Arjuna
set fire to it, the serpents fled in confusion and reached
Mannarasalay, and there prayed to the gods for protection; that
thereupon the earth around was miraculously cooled down, and hence the
name mun-l-ari-l-sala, the place where the earth was cooled. After the
serpents found shelter from the Khandava fire, an ancestress of the
Nambiathy had a vision calling upon her to dedicate the groves and some
land to the N&#257;ga R&#257;ja (snake king), and build a temple
therein. These commands were obeyed forth-with, and thenceforward the
N&#257;ga R&#257;ja became their family deity.&rsquo; In the
&lsquo;Travancore State Manual,&rsquo; Mr Nagam Iyer, referring to
Mannarsala, says that &lsquo;a member of this Mannarsala illam married
a girl of the Vettikod illam, where the serpents were held in great
veneration. The girl&rsquo;s parents, being very poor, had nothing to
give in the way of dowry, so they gave her one of the stone idols of
the serpent, of which there were many in the house. The girl took care
of this idol, and worshipped it regularly. Soon she became pregnant,
and gave birth to a male child and a snake. The snake child grew up,
and gave rise to a numerous progeny. They were all removed to a spot
where the present kavu (grove) is. In this kavu there are now four
thousand stone idols representing snake gods.&rsquo; Such is the origin
of this celebrated grove of Central Travancore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the bank of the river separating Cranganore from the rest of the
Native State of Cochin is the residence of a certain Br&#257;hman
called the P&#257;mpanmekkat (snake guardian) Namb&#363;dri, who has
been called the high priest of serpent worship. It is recorded<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2318src" href="#xd26e2318" name=
"xd26e2318src">10</a> by Mr Karunakara Menon that, &ldquo;a respectable
family at Angadipuram (in Malabar) sold their ancestral house to a
supervisor in the Local Fund P. W. D. (Public Works Department). He cut
down the snake grove, and planted it up. Some members <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>of
the vendor&rsquo;s family began to suffer from some cutaneous
complaint. As usual the local astrologer was called in, and he
attributed the ailment to the ire of the aggrieved family serpents.
These men then went to the Br&#257;hmin house of Pampu Mekat. This
Namboodri family is a special favourite of the snakes. When a new
serpent grove has to be created, or if it is found necessary to remove
a grove from one place to another, the ritual is entirely in the hands
of these people. When a family suffers from the wrath of the serpents,
they generally go to this Namboodri house. The eldest woman of the
house would hear the grievances of the party, and then, taking a vessel
full of gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil, and looking into it, would give
out the directions to be observed in satisfying the
serpents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the P&#257;mpanmekkat Namb&#363;dri, Mr Gopal Panikkar
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2330src" href="#xd26e2330" name=
"xd26e2330src">11</a> that, &ldquo;it is said that this Namb&#363;dri
household is full of cobras, which find their abode in every nook and
corner of it. The inmates can scarcely move about without placing their
feet upon one of these serpents. Owing to the magic influence of the
family, the serpents cannot and will not injure them. The serpents are
said to be always at the beck and call of the members of this
Namb&#363;dri family, and render unquestioned obedience to their
commands. They watch and protect the interests of the family in the
most zealous spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2335src" href="#xd26e2335"
name="xd26e2335src">12</a> that, &ldquo;every year the Namb&#363;dri
receives many offerings in the shape of golden images of snakes, for
propitiating the serpent god to ward off calamity, or to enlist its aid
in the cure of a disease, or for the attainment of a particular object.
It is well known that the Namb&#363;dri has several hundreds of these
images and other valuable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>offerings, the collection of
centuries, amounting in value to over a lakh of rupees. This aroused
the cupidity of a gang of dacoits (robbers), who resolved some years
ago to ease the Namb&#363;dri of a great portion of this treasure. On a
certain night, armed with lathies (sticks), slings, torches, and other
paraphernalia, the dacoits went to the illam, and, forcibly effecting
an entrance, bound the senior <span class="corr" id="xd26e2342" title=
"Source: Nambutri&rsquo;s">Namb&#363;dri&rsquo;s</span> hands and feet,
and threw him on his breast. This precaution taken, the keys of the
treasure-room were demanded, the alternative being further personal
injury. To save himself from further violence, the keys were
surrendered. The dacoits secured all the gold images, leaving the
silver ones severely alone, and departed. But, directly they went past
the gate of the house, many snakes chased them, and, in the twinkling
of an eye, each of the depredators had two snakes coiled round him,
others investing the gang, and threatening, with uplifted hoods and
hisses, to dart at them. The dacoits remained stunned and motionless.
Meantime, the authorities were communicated with, and the whole gang
was taken into custody. It is said that the serpents did not budge an
inch until after the arrival of the officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other marvellous stories of the way in which the snakes carry out
their trust are narrated.</p>
<p>A section of Ambalav&#257;sis or temple servants in Malabar, called
T&#275;yyamb&#257;dis, the members of which dance and sing in Bhagavati
temples, perform a song called N&#257;gap&#257;ttu (song in honour of
snakes) in private houses, which is supposed to be effective in
procuring offspring.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2350src" href=

<p>In many houses of the Tiyans of Malabar, offerings are made annually
to a bygone personage named Kunnath N&#257;yar, and to his friend and
disciple, Kunhi R&#257;yan, a M&#257;ppilla (Muhammadan). According to
the legend, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span>N&#257;yar worshipped the kite until he
obtained command and control over all the snakes in the land. There are
M&#257;ppilla devotees of Kunnath N&#257;yar and Kunhi R&#257;yan, who
exhibit snakes in a box, and collect alms for a snake mosque near
Manargh&#257;t at the foot of the N&#299;lgiri hills. A class of
snake-charmers in Malabar, called Kuravan, go about the country
exhibiting snakes. It is considered to be a great act of piety to
purchase these animals, and set them at liberty. The vagrant Kakkalans
of Travancore, who are said to be identical with the Kakka Kuravans,
are unrivalled at a dance called p&#257;mp&#257;tam (snake dance).</p>
<p>The Pulluvans of Malabar are astrologers, medicine-men, and priests
and singers in snake groves. According to a legend<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2366src" href="#xd26e2366" name="xd26e2366src">14</a> they are
descended from a male and female servant, who were exiled by a
Br&#257;hman in connection with the rescuing by the female of a snake
which escaped when the G&#257;ndava forest was set on fire by Agni, the
god of fire. Another legend records how a five-hooded snake fled from
the burning forest, and was taken home by a woman, and placed in a
room. When her husband entered the room, he found an ant-hill, from
which the snake issued forth, and bit him. As the result of the bite,
the man died, and his widow was left without means of support. The
snake consoled her, and devised a plan, by which she could maintain
herself. She was to go from house to house, and cry out, &ldquo;Give me
alms, and be saved from snake-poisoning.&rdquo; The inmates would give
alms, and the snakes, which might be troubling them, would cease to
annoy. For this reason, the Pulluvas, when they go with their pot-drum
(pulluva kudam) to a house, are asked to play, and sing songs which are
acceptable to the snake gods, in return for which they receive a
present of money. A Pulluvan and his wife preside at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>the
ceremony called P&#257;mban Tullal, which is carried out with the
object of propitiating the snake gods. Concerning this ceremony, Mr L.
K. Anantha Krishna Iyer writes as follows<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2373src" href="#xd26e2373" name="xd26e2373src">15</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A pandal (booth) supported by four poles driven
into the ground is put up for the purpose, and the tops of the poles
are connected with a network of strings, over which a silk or red cloth
is spread to form a canopy. The pandal is well decorated, and the floor
below it is slightly raised and smoothed. A hideous figure of the size
of a big serpent is drawn in rice-flour, turmeric (<i>Curcuma
longa</i>), kuvva(<i>Curcuma angustifolia</i>), powdered charcoal, and
a green powder. These five powders are essential, for their colours are
visible on the necks of serpents. Some rice is scattered on the floor
and on the sides, and ripe and green cocoanuts are placed on a small
quantity of rice and paddy (unhusked rice) on each side. A p&#363;ja
for Ganapathi (the elephant god) is performed, to see that the whole
ceremony terminates well. A good deal of frankincense is burned, and a
lamp is placed on a plate, to add to the purity, sanctity, and
solemnity of the occasion. The members of the house go round the pandal
as a token of reverence, and take their seats close by. It often
happens that the members of several neighbouring families take part in
the ceremony. The women, from whom devils have to be cast out, bathe
and take their seats on the western side, each with a flower-pod of the
areca palm. The Pulluvan, with his wife or daughter, begins his shrill
musical tunes (on serpents), vocal and instrumental alternately. As
they sing, the young female members appear to be influenced by the
modulation of the tunes and the smell of the perfumes. They gradually
move their heads in a circle, which soon quickens, and the long locks
of hair are soon let loose. These movements appear to keep time with
the Pulluvan&rsquo;s music. In their unconscious state, they beat upon
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>floor, and wipe off the figure drawn. As soon as
this is done, they go to a serpent grove close by, where there may be a
few stone images of serpents, before which they prostrate themselves.
They now recover their consciousness, and take milk, water of the green
cocoanut, and plantain fruits, and the ceremony is over.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In connection with the P&#257;mban Tullal, Mr Gopal Panikkar
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2390src" href="#xd26e2390" name=
"xd26e2390src">16</a> that &ldquo;sometimes the gods appear in the
bodies of all these females, and sometimes only in those of a select
few, or none at all. The refusal of the gods to enter into such persons
is symbolical of some want of cleanliness in them; which contingency is
looked upon as a source of anxiety to the individual. It may also
suggest the displeasure of these gods towards the family, in respect of
which the ceremony is performed. In either case, such refusal on the
part of the gods is an index of their ill-will or dissatisfaction. In
cases where the gods refuse to appear in any one of those seated for
the purpose, the ceremony is prolonged until the gods are so
propitiated as to constrain them to manifest themselves. Then, after
the lapse of the number of days fixed for the ceremony, and, after the
will of the serpent gods is duly expressed, the ceremonies
close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is said, it may be considered necessary to rub away
the figure as many as one hundred and one times, in which case the
ceremony is prolonged over several weeks. Each time that the snake
design is destroyed, one or two men, with torches in their hands,
perform a dance, keeping step to the Pulluvan&rsquo;s music. The family
may eventually erect a small platform or shrine in a corner of their
grounds, and worship at it annually. The snake deity will not, it is
believed, manifest himself if any of the persons or articles required
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>for the ceremony are impure, <i>e.g.</i>, if the
pot-drum has been polluted by the touch of a menstruating female. The
Pulluvan, from whom a drum was purchased for the Madras Museum, was
very reluctant to part with it, lest it should be touched by an impure
woman. In addition to the pot-drum, the Pulluvans play on a lute with
snakes painted on the reptile skin, which is used in lieu of parchment.
The skin, in a specimen which I acquired, is apparently that of the big
lizard <i>Varanus bengalensis</i>. The lute is played with a bow, to
which a metal bell is attached.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Madras Census Report,&rdquo; 1871,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2405src" href="#xd26e2405" name="xd26e2405src">17</a>
Surgeon-Major Cornish states that there is a place near Vaisarpadi,
close to Madras, in which the worship of the living snakes draws crowds
of votaries, who make holiday excursions to the temple, generally on
Sundays, in the hope of seeing the snakes, which are preserved in the
temple grounds; and, he adds, probably as long as the desire of
offspring is a leading characteristic of the Indian people, so long
will the worship of the serpent, or of snake-stones, be a popular cult.
He describes further how, at Rajahmundry in the Telugu country, he came
across an old ant-hill by the side of a public road, on which was
placed a stone representing a cobra, and the ground all round was stuck
over with pieces of wood carved very rudely in the shape of a snake.
These were the offerings left by devotees at the abode taken up by an
old snake, who would occasionally come out of his hole, and feast on
the eggs and gh&#299; (clarified butter) left for him by his adorers.
Around this place he saw many women who had come to pray at the shrine.
If they chanced to see the cobra, the omen was interpreted favourably,
and their prayers for progeny would be granted. <span class=

<p>Concerning snake worship in the Tamil country, Mr W. Francis writes
as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2412src" href="#xd26e2412" name=
"xd26e2412src">18</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A vow is taken by childless wives to
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2418" title="Source: instal">install</span>
a serpent (n&#257;gapratishtai), if they are blessed with offspring.
The ceremony consists in having a figure of a serpent cut in a stone
slab, placing it in a well for six months, giving it life
(pr&#257;napratishtai) by reciting mantrams and performing other
ceremonies over it, and then setting it up under a p&#299;pal tree
(<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), which has been married to a margosa (<i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>). Worship, which consists mainly in going round the
tree 108 times, is then performed to it for the next forty-five days.
Similar circumambulations will also bring good luck in a general way,
if carried out subsequently.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is further recorded by Mr F. R. Hemingway<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2430src" href="#xd26e2430" name="xd26e2430src">19</a> that,
&ldquo;Br&#257;hmans and the higher Vell&#257;lans think that children
can be obtained by worshipping the cobra. Vell&#257;lans and Kallans
perform the worship on a Friday. Among the Vell&#257;lans, this is
generally after the Pongal festival. The Vell&#257;lans make an old
woman cry aloud in the backyard that a sacrifice will be made to the
cobra next day, and that they pray it will accept the offering. At the
time of sacrifice, cooked jaggery (crude sugar) and rice, burning
gh&#299; in the middle of rice-flour, and an egg, are offered to the
cobra, and left in the backyard for its acceptance. The Pallis annually
worship the cobra by pouring milk on an ant-hill, and sacrificing a
fowl near it. Valaiyans, Pallans, and Paraiyans sacrifice a fowl in
their own backyards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Tamil country, children whose birth is attributed to a vow
taken by childless mothers to offer a snake cut on a stone slab,
sometimes have a name bearing reference <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>to snakes given to
them, <i>i.e.</i>, S&#275;sh&#257;chalam,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2440src" href="#xd26e2440" name="xd26e2440src">20</a>
S&#275;shamma, N&#257;gappa, or N&#257;gamma. N&#257;ga, N&#257;gasa,
or N&#257;g&#275;swara, occurs as the name of a totemistic exogamous
sept or g&#333;tra of various classes in Ganjam and Vizagapatam. In the
Odiya caste of farmers in Ganjam, members of the N&#257;gabonso sept
claim to be descendants of N&#257;gamuni, the serpent rishi.
N&#257;gavadam (cobra&rsquo;s hood) is the name of a subdivision of the
Tamil Pallis, who wear an ornament called n&#257;gavadam, representing
a cobra, in the dilated lobes of the ears.</p>
<p>Ant (<i>i.e.</i>, white-ant, <i>Termes</i>) hills, which have been
repeatedly referred to in this chapter, are frequently inhabited by
cobras, and offerings of milk, fruit, and flowers are consequently made
to them on certain ceremonial occasions. Thus it is recorded,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2452src" href="#xd26e2452" name=
"xd26e2452src">21</a> by the Rev. J. Cain that when he was living in
Ellore Fort in the God&#257;vari district, in September, 1873, &ldquo;a
large crowd of people, chiefly women and children, came in, and visited
every white-ant hill, poured upon each their offerings of milk,
flowers, and fruit, to the intense delight of all the crows in the
neighbourhood. The day was called the N&#257;gula
Chaturdhi&mdash;Chaturdhi, the fourth day of the eighth lunar
month&mdash;and was said to be the day when V&#257;suki, Takshak&#257;,
and the rest of the thousand N&#257;gulu were born to Kasyapa Brahma by
his wife Kadruva.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2455src" href="#xd26e2455"
name="xd26e2455src">22</a> The other chief occasions when these
ant-hills are resorted to are when people are affected with earache or
pains in the eye, and certain skin diseases. They visit the ant-hills,
pour out milk, cold rice, fruit, etc., and carry away part of the
earth, which they apply to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>troublesome member, and, if
they afterwards call in a Br&#257;hman to repeat a mantra or two, they
feel sure the complaint will soon vanish. Many parents first cut their
children&rsquo;s hair near one of these hillocks, and offer the first
fruits of the hair to the serpents residing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colossal Jain figure of Gomat&#275;svara, Gummatta, or Gomata
R&#257;ya, at Sr&#257;vana Belgola in Mysore,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2464src" href="#xd26e2464" name="xd26e2464src">23</a> is
represented as surrounded by white-ant hills, from which snakes are
emerging, and with a climbing plant twining itself round the legs and
arms.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the snake festival in the Telugu country, the
B&#333;ya women worship the N&#257;gala Sw&#257;mi (snake god) by
fasting, and pouring milk into the holes of white-ant hills. By this a
double object is fulfilled. The ant-hill is a favourite dwelling of the
cobra, and was, moreover, the burial-place of Valm&#299;ki, from whom
the B&#333;yas claim to be descended. Valm&#299;ki was the author of
the R&#257;m&#257;yana, and is believed to have done penance for so
long in one spot that a white-ant hill grew up round him. On the
N&#257;garapanchami day, Ling&#257;yats worship the image of a snake
made of earth from a snake&rsquo;s hole with offerings of milk, rice,
cocoanuts, flowers, etc. During the month Aswija, Ling&#257;yat girls
collect earth from ant-hills, and place it in a heap at the village
temple. Every evening they go there with wave-offerings, and worship
the heap. At the Dip&#257;vali festival,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2469src" href="#xd26e2469" name="xd26e2469src">24</a> the
Gamallas (Telugu toddy-drawers) bathe in the early morning, and go in
wet clothes to an ant-hill, before which they prostrate themselves, and
pour a little water into one of the holes. Round the hill they wind
five turns of cotton thread, and return home. Subsequently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>they
come once more to the ant-hill with a lamp made of flour paste.
Carrying the light, they go three or five times round the hill, and
throw split pulse (<i>Phaseolus Mungo</i>) into one of the holes. On
the following morning they again go to the hill, pour milk into it, and
snap the threads wound round it.</p>
<p>The famous temple of Subramanya in South Canara is said to have been
in charge of the Subramanya St&#257;nikas (temple servants), till it
was wrested from them by the Shivalli Br&#257;hmans. In former times,
the privilege of sticking a golden ladle into a heap of food piled up
in the temple on the Shasti day is said to have belonged to the
St&#257;nikas. They also brought earth from an ant-hill on the previous
day. Food from the heap, and some of the earth, are received as sacred
articles by devotees who visit the sacred shrine.</p>
<p>At the Smasan&#257;kollai festival in honour of the goddess
Ankalamma at Malayan&#363;r, some thousands of people congregate at the
temple. In front of the stone idol is a large ant-hill, on which two
copper idols are placed, and a brass vessel is placed at the base of
the hill, to receive the various offerings.</p>
<p>At a wedding among the nomad Lamb&#257;dis, the bride and bridegroom
pour milk into an ant-hill, and offer cocoanuts, milk, etc., to the
snake which lives therein. During the marriage ceremonies of the
Dand&#257;sis (village watchmen in Ganjam), a fowl is sacrificed at an
ant-hill. At a B&#275;dar (Canarese cultivator) wedding, the earth from
an ant-hill is spread near five water-pots, and on it are scattered
some paddy (unhusked rice) and dh&#257;l (<i>Cajanus indicus</i>)
seeds. The spot is visited later on, and the seeds should have
sprouted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=

<p class="first">In addition to the observance of penances and fasting,
Hindus of all castes, high and low, make vows and offerings to the
gods, with the object of securing their good-will or appeasing their
anger. By the lower castes, offerings of animals&mdash;fowls, sheep,
goats, or buffaloes&mdash;are made, and the gods whom they seek to
propitiate are minor deities, <i>e.g.</i>, Ellamma or Muneswara, to
whom animal sacrifices are acceptable.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2497src" href="#xd26e2497" name="xd26e2497src">1</a> The higher
castes usually perform vows to Venkat&#275;swara of Tirupati,
Subramanya of Palni, V&#299;rar&#257;ghava of Tiruvallur,
Tirun&#257;rayana of M&#275;lkote, and other celebrated gods. But they
may, if afflicted with serious illness, at times, as at the leaf
festival at Periyapalayam (p. 148), seek the good offices of minor
deities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A shrine,&rdquo; Mr F. Fawcett writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2506src" href="#xd26e2506" name="xd26e2506src">2</a>
&ldquo;to which the Malay&#257;lis (inhabitants of Malabar),
N&#257;yars included, resort is that of Subramaniya at Palni in the
north-west of the Madura district. Not only are vows paid to this
shrine, but men, letting their hair grow for a year after their
father&rsquo;s death, proceed to have it cut there. The plate shows an
ordinary Palni pilgrim. The arrangement which he is carrying is called
a k&#257;vadi (portable shrine). There <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>are two kinds of
k&#257;vadi, a milk k&#257;vadi containing milk, and a fish k&#257;vadi
containing fish. The vow may be made in respect of either, each being
appropriate to certain circumstances. [Miniature silver k&#257;vadis,
and miniature crowns, are sometimes offered by pilgrims to the god.]
When the time comes near for the pilgrim to start for Palni, he dresses
in reddish-orange clothes, shoulders his k&#257;vadi, and starts out.
Together with a man ringing a bell, and perhaps one with a tom-tom,
with ashes on his face, he assumes the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a beggar.
The well-to-do are inclined to reduce the beggar period to the minimum,
but a beggar every votary must be, and as a beggar he goes to Palni in
all humbleness and humiliation, and there he fulfils his vow, leaves
his k&#257;vadi and his hair, and a small sum of money. Though the
individuals about to be noticed were not N&#257;yars, their cases
illustrate very well the religious idea of the N&#257;yar as expressed
under certain circumstances. It was at Guruvay&#363;r (in Malabar) in
November 1895. On a high raised platform under a peepul tree were a
number of people under vows, bound for Palni. A boy of fourteen had
suffered as a child from epilepsy, and seven years ago his father vowed
on his behalf that, if he was cured, he would make his pilgrimage to
Palni. He wore a string of beads round his neck, and a like string on
his right arm. These were in some way connected with the vow. His head
was bent, and he sat motionless under his k&#257;vadi, leaning on the
bar, which, when he carried it, rested on his shoulder. He could not go
to Palni until it was revealed to him in a dream when he was to start.
He had waited for his dream seven years, subsisting on roots (yams,
etc.), and milk&mdash;no rice. Now he had had the longed-for dream, and
was about to start. Another pilgrim was a man wearing an oval band of
silver over the lower portion of the forehead, almost covering his
eyes; his tongue protruding beyond the mouth, and kept in position by a
silver skewer through it. The skewer was put in the day before, and was
to be left in for forty days. He had been fasting for two years. He was
much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>under the influence of the god, and whacking
incessantly at a drum in delicious excitement. Several of the pilgrims
had a handkerchief tied over the mouth, they being under a vow of
silence. [At Kumbakonam in the Tanjore district, &lsquo;there is a math
in honour of a recently deceased saint named Parad&#275;si, who
attained wide fame in the district some years ago. He never spoke, and
was welcomed and feasted everywhere, and was the subject of many vows.
People used to promise to break cocoanuts in his presence, or clothe
him with fine garments, if they obtained their desire, and such vows
were believed to be very efficacious.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2518src" href="#xd26e2518" name="xd26e2518src">3</a> At the
Manj&#275;shwar Temple in South Canara, there is a Darsana, (man who
gets inspired) called the dumb Darsana, as he gives signs instead of
speaking. Bishop Whitehead records<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2525src"
href="#xd26e2525" name="xd26e2525src">4</a> the case of a Br&#257;hman,
who had taken a vow of silence for twenty-one years, because people
make so much mischief by talking. He conversed by means of signs and
writing in the dust]. One poor man wore the regular instrument of
silence, the mouth-lock<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2530src" href=
"#xd26e2530" name="xd26e2530src">5</a>&mdash;a wide silver band over
the mouth, and a skewer piercing both cheeks. He sat patiently in a
tent-like affair. People fed him with milk, etc. The use of the
mouth-lock is common with the N&#257;yars, when they assume the
pilgrim&rsquo;s robes and set out for Palni. Pilgrims generally go in
crowds under charge of a priestly guide, one who, having made a certain
number of journeys to the shrine, wears a peculiar sash and other
gear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In connection with k&#257;vadis, it may be noted that, at the time
of the annual migration of the sacred herd of cattle belonging to the
K&#257;ppiliyans (Canarese farmers in the Madura district) to the
hills, the driver is said to carry a pot of fresh-drawn milk within a
k&#257;vadi. On the day on which the return journey to the Kambam
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>valley is commenced, the pot is opened, and the
milk is said to be found in a hardened state. A slice thereof is cut
off, and given to each person who accompanied the herd to the hills. It
is believed that the milk would not remain in good condition, if the
sacred herd had been in any way injuriously affected during its sojourn
there. The usual vow performed at the shrine of
Dand&#257;yudhap&#257;ni or Subramanya near Settikulam in the
Trichinopoly district is to carry milk, sugar, flour, etc., in a
k&#257;vadi, and offer it to the god.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2543src" href="#xd26e2543" name="xd26e2543src">6</a> A case is
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2546src" href="#xd26e2546" name=
"xd26e2546src">7</a> from Ceylon, in which a man who was about to
proceed with a k&#257;vadi to a shrine was held by several men, while a
blow with the palm of the hand caught him in the middle of the back, to
numb the pain created by the forcing of sharp iron hooks into the
fleshy part of the back.</p>
<p>Reference has been made (p. 137) to the offering of hair by devotees
at the Palni shrine. When people are prevented from going to a temple
at the proper time, hair is sometimes removed from their
children&rsquo;s head, sealed up in a vessel, and put into the
receptacle for offerings when the visit to the temple is paid. In cases
of dangerous sickness, the hair is sometimes cut off, and offered to a

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The sacrifice of locks,&rdquo; Mr A. Srinivasan
writes, &ldquo;is meant to propitiate deceased relations, and the deity
which presides over life&rsquo;s little joys and sorrows. It is a
similar intention that has dictated the ugly disfigurement of widows.
We meet with the identical fact and purpose in the habit of Telugu
Br&#257;hmans and non-Br&#257;hmans in general, sacrificing their whole
locks of hair to the goddess Ganga of Prayaga, to the god
Venkat&#275;sa of Tirupati, and other local gods. The Br&#257;hman
ladies of the south have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=

Ganga and other gods with just one or two locks of hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes, in performance of a vow, Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran (Madura
weaver) boys are taken to the shrine at Tirupati for the tonsure

<p>Writing in 1872, Mr Breeks remarked<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2575src" href="#xd26e2575" name="xd26e2575src">11</a> that
&ldquo;about Ootacamund, a few Todas have latterly begun to imitate the
religious practices of their native neighbours, and my particular
friend Kinniaven, after an absence of some days, returned with a shaven
head from a visit to the temple of Siva at Nanjengudi&rdquo; (in
Mysore).</p>
<p>A Toda who came to see me had his hair hanging down in long tails
reaching below the shoulders. He had, he said, let it grow long because
his wife, though married five years, had borne no child. A child had,
however, recently been born, and he was going to sacrifice his locks as
a thank-offering at the Nanjeng&#333;d temple. By the Badagas of the
N&#299;lgiris, the fire-walking ceremony is celebrated to <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2580" title="Source: propitate">propitiate</span> the
deity Jeddayasw&#257;mi, to whom vows are made. In token thereof, they
grow one twist or plait of hair, which is finally cut off as an
offering to Jeddayasw&#257;mi. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"

<p>By some Gavaras (a cultivating caste) of Vizagapatam, special
reverence is paid to the deity Jaggan&#257;thasw&#257;mi of Orissa,
whose shrine at Puri is visited by some, while others take vows in the
name of the god. On the day of the car festival at Puri, local car
festivals are held in Gavara villages, and women carry out the
performance of their vows. A woman, for example, who is under a vow, in
order that she may be cured of illness or bear children, takes a big
pot of water, and, placing it on her head, dances frantically before
the god, through whose influence the water which rises out of the pot
falls back into it, instead of being spilt. The class of Vaishnavite
mendicants called D&#257;sari claims descent from a wealthy
S&#363;dra,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2586src" href="#xd26e2586" name=
"xd26e2586src">12</a> who, having no offspring, vowed that, if he was
blessed with children, he would devote one to the service of the deity.
He subsequently had many sons, one of whom he named D&#257;san, and
placed entirely at the service of the god. D&#257;san forfeited all
claim to his father&rsquo;s estate, and his descendants are therefore
all beggars.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2589src" href="#xd26e2589"
name="xd26e2589src">13</a> In a note on the D&#257;saris of
Mysore,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2592src" href="#xd26e2592" name=
"xd26e2592src">14</a> it is stated that &ldquo;they become D&#257;sas
or servants dedicated to the god at Tirupati by virtue of a peculiar
vow, made either by themselves or their relatives at some moment of
anxiety or danger, and live by begging in his name. Among certain
castes (<i>e.g.</i>, Banajiga, Tigala, and Vakkaliga), the custom of
taking a vow to become a D&#257;sari prevails. In fulfilment of that
vow, the person becomes a D&#257;sari, and his eldest son is bound to
follow suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be noted that, in the Canarese country, a custom obtains
among the B&#275;dars and some other castes, under which a family which
has no male issue must dedicate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>one of its daughters as a
Basavi.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2604src" href="#xd26e2604" name=

the god, a t&#257;li (marriage badge) and toe-rings being put on her.
Thenceforward she becomes a public woman, except that she should not
consort with any one of lower caste than herself. It may be added that
a Basavi usually lives faithfully with one man, and she works for her
family as hard as any other woman.</p>
<p>Married couples, to whom offspring is born after the performance of
a vow, sometimes name it after the deity whose aid has been invoked,
such as Sriniv&#257;sa at Tirupati, Lakshminarasimha at Sholing&#363;r,
or some other local god or goddess. At Negapatam, some Hindus make vows
to the M&#299;r&#257;n (Muhammadan saint) of N&#257;gur, and name their
child after him. The name thus given is not, however, used in every-day
life, but abandoned like the ceremonial name given prior to the Hindu
upan&#257;yana ceremony. In the Telugu country, the poorer classes of
Hindus sometimes promise that, if a son is born to them, they will call
him after a Muhammadan Fakir, and, consequently, it is far from
uncommon to find a Hindu named Fakirgadu or Fakirappa, with a Hindu
termination to a Muhammadan commencement.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It has been noted (p. 138) that some pilgrims to the shrine at Palni
have a skewer piercing both cheeks. It is recorded by Bishop
Whitehead<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2621src" href="#xd26e2621" name=
"xd26e2621src">17</a> that &ldquo;devotees go to the shrine of Durgamma
at Bellary with silver pins about six inches long thrust through their
cheeks, and with a lighted lamp in a brass dish on their head. On
arriving before the shrine, they place the lamp on the ground, and the
pin is removed, and offered to the goddess.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Bishop was told that the object of this ceremony is to enable
the devotee to come to the shrine with a concentrated mind.</p>
<p>A common form of vow made to M&#257;riamman at
P&#257;ppakk&#257;lpatti in the Trichinopoly district is a promise to
stick little iron skewers into the body. In performance of vows, the
S&#275;dans and Kaik&#333;lans (weaver castes) pierce some part of the
body with a spear. The latter thrust a spear through the muscles of the
abdomen in honour of their god S&#257;h&#257;-nayanar at Ratnagiri.</p>
<p>At the annual festival of the goddess Gangamma at Tirupati, a
Kaik&#333;lan devotee dances before the goddess, and, when he is worked
up to the proper pitch of frenzy, a metal wire is passed through the
middle of his tongue. It is believed that the operation causes no pain
or bleeding, and the only remedy adopted is the chewing of margosa
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves and some kunkumam (red powder) of the
goddess. If, during a temple car procession, the car refuses to move,
the V&#299;ramushtis (Ling&#257;yat mendicants), who are guardians of
the idol, cut themselves with their swords until it is set in motion.
There is a proverb that the Siva Br&#257;hman (temple priest) eats
well, whereas the V&#299;ramushti hurts himself with the sword, and
suffers much. The V&#299;ramushtis are said, in former days, to have
performed a ceremony called p&#257;vadam. When an orthodox
Ling&#257;yat was insulted, he would swallow his lingam, and lie flat
on the ground in front of the house of the offender, who had to collect
some Ling&#257;yats, and send for a V&#299;ramushti. He had to arrive
accompanied by a pregnant V&#299;ramushti woman, priests of Draupadi,
Pachaiamman, and Pothur&#257;ja temples, some individuals from the
nearest Ling&#257;yat mutt, and others. Arrived at the house, the
pregnant woman would sit down in front of the person lying on the
ground. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>With his sword the V&#299;ramushti man then made
cuts in his scalp and chest, and sprinkled the recumbent man with the
blood. He would then rise, and the lingam would come out of his mouth.
Mondi mendicants, when engaged in begging, cut the skin of the thighs
with a knife, lie down and beat their chest with a stone, vomit, roll
in the dust or mud, and throw ordure into the houses of those who will
not contribute alms. It was noted, in a recent report of the
Banganapalle State, that an in&#257;m (grant of rent-free land) was
held on condition of the holder &ldquo;ripping open his stomach&rdquo;
at a certain festival.</p>
<p>A vow performed in honour of the village goddess at Settikulam in
the Trichinopoly district is for the votaries, male and female, to
fling themselves on heaps of thorns before her. This vow is generally
fulfilled by those cured of disease. It is called mullu padagalam, or
bed of thorns.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2640src" href="#xd26e2640"
name="xd26e2640src">18</a> At the annual fire-walking festival at

"#xd26e2643" name="xd26e2643src">19</a> by the missionary Gloyer that,
on special occasions, some D&#333;mbs in Vizagapatam fall into a
frenzied state, in which they cut their flesh with sharp instruments,
or pass long, thin iron bars through the tongue and cheeks, during
which operation no blood must flow. For this purpose, the instruments
are rubbed over with some blood-congealing material. They also affect
sitting on a sacred swing, armed with long iron nails. Mr G. F.
Paddison informs me that he once saw a villager in the Vizagapatam
district sitting outside the house, while groans proceeded from within.
He explained that he was ill, and his wife was swinging on nails with
their points upwards, to cure him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146"

<p>In the Tanjore district, persons afflicted with disease promise
that, if they are cured, they will brand their bodies, go round a
temple a certain number of times by rolling over and over in the dust,
and offer a pregnant goat by stabbing it through the womb. Sometimes
vows of self-mortification are taken in anticipation of relief. Such
are undertaking to go without salt in one&rsquo;s food, or to eat
without using the hands, until a cure is effected.<a class="noteref"

that immunity is sometimes rendered doubly sure by putting sand or

miraculous power of hardening his skin, so that any one could have a
free shot at him without hurting him. In the M&#275;l&#363;r t&#257;luk

<p>The annual festival at the temple of Karamadai in the Coimbatore
district is visited by about forty or fifty thousand pilgrims,
belonging for the most part to the lower classes. In case of sickness
or other calamity, they take a vow to perform one of the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) To pour water at the feet of the idol inside the temple. Each
devotee is provided with a goat-skin bag, or a new earthen pot. He goes
to the tank, and, after bathing, fills the receptacle with water,
carries it to the temple, and empties it before the idol. This is
repeated a number of times according to the nature of the vow. If the
vow is a life-long one, it has to be performed every year until
death.</p>
<p>(2) To give kavalam to D&#257;saris (religious mendicants). Kavalam
consists of plantain fruits cut up into small slices, and mixed with
sugar, jaggery (crude sugar), fried grain, or beaten rice. The
D&#257;saris are attached to the temple, and wear short drawers, with
strings of small brass bells tied to their wrists and ankles. They
appear to be possessed, and move wildly about to the beating of drums.
As they go about, the devotees put some of the kavalam into their
mouths. The D&#257;saris eat a little, and spit out the remainder into
the hands of the devotees, who eat it. This is believed to cure all
disease, and to give children to those who partake of it. In addition
to kavalam, some put betel leaves in the mouths of the D&#257;saris,
who, after chewing them, spit them into the mouths of the devotees. At
night the D&#257;saris carry torches made of rags, on which the
devotees pour gh&#299; (clarified butter). Some people say that, many
years ago, barren women used to take a vow to visit the temple at the
time of the festival, and, after offering kavalam, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>have
sexual intercourse with the D&#257;saris. The temple authorities,
however, profess ignorance of this practice.</p>
<p>On the last day of the Gangajatra festival at Tirupati, a figure is
made of clay and straw, and placed in the tope (grove), where crowds of
all classes, including Paraiyans, present food to it. Buffaloes, goats,
sheep, and fowls are sacrificed, and it is said that Br&#257;hmans,
though they will not be present, send animals to be slaughtered. At the
conclusion of the festivities, the image is burnt during the feast,
which last over ten days, the lower orders of the people paint
themselves, and indulge in much boisterous merriment. Those who have
made a vow to Ganga fast for some days before the festival begins. They
wear a structure made of bamboo in the form of a car, which is
decorated with paper of different colours, and supported by iron nails
pressed into the belly and back. They go about with this structure on
their heads. Those who have been attacked by cholera, or other serious
disease, make a vow to Ganga, and perform this ceremonial.</p>
<p>A festival, which is attended by huge crowds of Hindus of all
classes, takes place annually in the month of Audi (July-August) at the
village of Periyap&#257;layam, about sixteen miles from Madras, where
the goddess M&#257;riamma is worshipped under the name of
Periyap&#257;layaththamman. According to the legend, as narrated by the
Rev. A. C. Clayton,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2674src" href=
"#xd26e2674" name="xd26e2674src">23</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;there was once a Rishi (sage), who lived on the
banks of the Periyap&#257;layam river with his wife Bav&#257;ni. Every
morning she used to bathe in the river, and bring back water for the
use of the household. But she never took any vessel with her in which
to bring the water home, for she was so chaste that she had acquired
power to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>form a water-pot out of the dry river sand, and
carry the water home in it. One day, while bathing, she saw the
reflection of the face of the sky-god, Indra, in the water, and could
not help admiring it. When she returned to the bank of the river, and
tried to form her water-pot out of sand as usual, she could not do so,
for her admiration of Indra had ruined her power, and she went home
sadly to fetch a brass water-vessel. Her husband saw her carrying this
to the river, and at once suspected her of unchastity, and, calling his
son, ordered him to strike off her head with a sword. It was in vain
that the son tried to avoid matricide. He had to obey, but he was so
agitated by his feelings that, when at last he struck at his mother, he
cut off not only her head, but that of a leather-dresser&rsquo;s wife
who was standing near. The two bodies lay side by side. The rishi was
so pleased with his son&rsquo;s obedience that he promised him any
favour that he should ask, but he was very angry when the son at once
begged that his mother might be restored to life. Being compelled to
keep his word, he told the son that, if he put his mother&rsquo;s head
on her trunk, she would again live. The son tried to do so, but in his
haste took up the head of the leather-dresser&rsquo;s wife by mistake,
and put it on Bav&#257;ni&rsquo;s body. Leather-dressers are
flesh-eaters, and so it comes about that, on days when her festival is
celebrated, Bav&#257;ni&mdash;now a goddess&mdash;longs for meat, and
thousands of sheep, goats, and fowls, must be slain at her shrine. This
legend bears marks of Br&#257;hmanic influence. Curiously enough, the
priest of this Paraiya shrine is himself a Br&#257;hman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vows, which are performed at the festival at Periyap&#257;layam,
are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Wearing a garment of margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves,
or wearing an ordinary garment, and carrying a lighted lamp made of
rice-flour on the head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>(2) Carrying a pot decorated with flowers and margosa leaves round
the temple.</p>
<p>(3) Going round the temple, rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>(4) Throwing a live fowl on to the top of the temple.</p>
<p>(5) Throwing a cocoanut in front, prostrating on the ground in
salutation, going forward several paces and again throwing the
cocoanut, and repeating the procedure till three circuits of the temple
have been made.</p>
<p>(6) Giving offerings to the idol Parasur&#257;ma, cradle with baby
made of clay or wood, etc., to bring offspring to the childless,
success in a lawsuit or business transaction, and other good luck. In
addition, pongal (boiled rice) has to be offered, and by some a sheep
or goat is sacrificed. If a vow has been made on behalf of a sick cow,
the animal is bathed in the river, clad in margosa leaves, and led
round the temple. The leaf-wearing vow is resorted to by the large
majority of the devotees, and performed by men, women and children.
Those belonging to the more respectable classes go through it in the
early morning, before the crowd has collected in its tens of thousands.
The leafy garments are purchased from hawkers, who do a brisk trade in
the sale thereof. The devotees have to pay a modest fee for admission
to the temple precincts, and go round the shrine three or more times.
Concerning the Periyap&#257;layam festival, a recent writer observes
that, &ldquo;the distinctive feature is that the worshippers are clad
in leaves. The devotees are bound to wear a garment made of fresh
margosa twigs with their leaves. This garment is called
v&#275;pansilai. It consists of a string three or four yards long, from
which depend, at intervals of two to three inches apart, twigs
measuring about two feet in length, and forming a fringe of foliage.
This string being wound several times round the waist, the fringe of
leaves forms <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>a kilt or short petticoat. Men are content to
wear the kilt, but women also wear round their neck a similar garment,
which forms a short cloak reaching to the waist. To impress on devotees
the imperative obligation imposed on them to wear the leaf garment in
worshipping the goddess, it is said that a young married woman, being
without children, made a vow to the goddess that, on obtaining a son,
she would go on a pilgrimage to Periyap&#257;layam, and worship her in
accordance with the ancient rite. Her prayer having been answered, she
gave birth to a son, and went to Periyap&#257;layam to fulfil her vow.
When, however, it was time to undress and put on the v&#275;pansilai,
her modesty revolted. Unobserved by her party, she secretly tied a
cloth round her waist before putting on the v&#275;pansilai. So
attired, she went to the temple to worship. On seeing her coming, the
goddess detected her deceit, and, waxing wroth, set the woman&rsquo;s
dress all ablaze, and burnt her so severely that she died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Bishop Whitehead<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2708src"
href="#xd26e2708" name="xd26e2708src">24</a> that it was formerly the
custom for women to come to the shrine of Durgamma at Bellary clad in
twigs of the margosa tree. But this is now only done by children, the
grown-up women putting the margosa twigs over a cloth wrapped round the
loins. At a festival of the village goddess at Kudligi in the Bellary
district, the procession is said by Mr F. Fawcett to be headed by a
M&#257;diga (Telugu Pariah) naked save for a few margosa leaves. The
wearing of these leaves on the occasion of festivals in honour of
M&#257;riamma is a very general custom throughout Southern India.
Garments made of leaves are still worn by the females of some tribes on
the west coast, <i>e.g.</i>, the Thanda Pulayans, Vettuvans, and
Koragas. Concerning the Koragas, Mr Walhouse writes<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2716src" href="#xd26e2716" name="xd26e2716src">25</a> that
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>&ldquo;wear an apron of twigs and leaves over
the buttocks. Once this was the only covering allowed them, and a mark
of their deep degradation. But now, when no longer compulsory, and of
no use, as it is worn over the clothes, the women still retain it,
believing its disuse would be unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;K&#363;vv&#257;kkam in the South Arcot district
is known for its festival to Arav&#257;n (more correctly
Ir&#257;v&#257;n) or K&#363;tt&#257;ndar, which is one of the most
popular feasts with S&#363;dras in the whole district. Arav&#257;n was
the son of Arjuna, one of the five P&#257;ndava brothers. Local
traditions says that, when the great war which is described in the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata was about to begin, the Kauravas, the opponents
of the P&#257;ndavas, to bring them success, sacrificed a white
elephant. The P&#257;ndavas were in despair of being able to find any
such uncommon object with which to propitiate the gods, until Arjuna
suggested that they should offer up his son Arav&#257;n. Arav&#257;n
agreed to yield his life for the good of the cause, and, when
eventually the P&#257;ndavas were victorious, he was deified for the
self-abnegation which had thus brought his side success. Since he died
in his youth, before he had been married, it is held to please him if
men, even though grown up and already wedded, come now and offer to
espouse him, and men who are afflicted with serious diseases take a vow
to marry him at his annual festival in the hope of thereby being cured.
The festival occurs in May, and for eighteen nights the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata is recited by a Palli (Tamil
agriculturist),<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2724src" href="#xd26e2724"
name="xd26e2724src">26</a> large numbers of people, especially of that
caste, assembling to hear it read. On the eighteenth night, a wooden
image of K&#363;tt&#257;ndar is taken to a tope (grove) and seated
there. This is the signal for the sacrifice of an enormous number of
fowls. Every one who comes brings one or two, and the number killed
runs literally into thousands. While this is going on, all the men who
have taken vows to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>married to the deity appear before
his image dressed like women, make obeisance, offer to the priest (who
is a Palli by caste) a few annas, and give into his hands the
t&#257;lis (marriage badge worn by women) which they have brought with
them. These the priest, as representing the God, ties round their
necks. The God is brought back to his shrine that night, and, when in
front of the building, he is hidden by a cloth held before him. This
symbolises the sacrifice of Arav&#257;n, and the men who have just been
married to him set up loud lamentations at the death of their husband.
Similar vows are taken and ceremonies performed, it is said, at the
shrines of K&#363;tt&#257;ndar, two miles north-west of Porto Novo, and
&#256;divar&#257;hanattum (five miles north-west of Chidambaram), and,
in recent years, at Tiruvarkkulam (one mile east of the latter place);
other cases probably occur.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2729src"

<p>I am informed by Mr R. F. Stoney that, in the Madura district, iron
chains are hung on b&#257;b&#363;l (<i>Acacia arabica</i>) trees, and
dedicated to the rustic deity Karuppan. At M&#275;l&#363;r Mr Stoney
saw large masses of such chains, which are made by the village
blacksmiths. They are very rough, and are furnished at one end with
what is said to be a sickle, and also a spear-head. I gather
further<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2744src" href="#xd26e2744" name=
"xd26e2744src">28</a> that, in the M&#275;l&#363;r t&#257;luk, the
shrine of Karuppan may usually be known by the hundreds of chains hung
outside it, which have been presented to the god in performance of
vows. The deity is said to be fond of bedecking himself with chains,
and these offerings are usually suspended from a kind of horizontal bar
made of two stone uprights supporting a slab of stone placed
horizontally upon the top of them. The god is also fond of presents of
clubs and swords.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; a recent writer states,
&ldquo;a big chain hangs suspended from a tree, and the village
panch&#257;yats <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154"
name="pb154">154</a>]</span>(tribunals) are held in the Aiyanar (or
Sangali Karuppan) temple. The accused is made to submit to an ordeal in
proof of innocence. The ordeal consists in his swearing on the chain,
which he is made to touch. He has such a dread of this procedure, that,
as soon as he touches the chain, he comes out with the truth, failure
to speak the truth being punished by some calamity, which he believes
will overtake him within a week. These chains are also suspended to the
trees near the temples of village goddesses, and used by village
panch&#257;yats to swear the accused in any trial before
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is narrated<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2755src" href="#xd26e2755"
name="xd26e2755src">29</a> by Moor that he &ldquo;passed a tree, on
which were hanging several hundred bells. This was a superstitious
sacrifice by the Bandjanahs,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2758src" href=
"#xd26e2758" name="xd26e2758src">30</a> who, passing this tree, are in
the habit of hanging a bell or bells upon it, which they take from the
necks of their sick cattle, expecting to leave behind them the
complaint also. Our servants particularly cautioned us against touching
these diabolical bells; but, as a few were taken for our own cattle,
several accidents that happened were imputed to the anger of the deity
to whom these offerings were made, who, they say, inflicts the same
disorder on the unhappy bullock who carries a bell from this tree as he
relieved the donor from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Diguvemetta in the Kurnool district, I came across a number of
bells, both large and small, tied to the branches of a tamarind tree,
beneath which were an image of the deity Malalamma, and a stone bull
(Nandi). Suspended from a branch of the same tree was a thick rope, to
which were attached heads, skulls, mandibles, thigh-bones, and feet of
fowls, and the foot of a goat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"

<p>Mr Fawcett once saw, at a Savara village in Ganjam, a gaily
ornamented hut near a burning-ground. Rude figures of birds and red
rags were tied to five bamboos, which were sticking up in the air about
eight feet above the hut, one at each corner, and one in the centre. A
Savara said that he built the hut for his dead brother, and had buried
the bones in it.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2767src" href="#xd26e2767"
name="xd26e2767src">31</a> It is noted by the Rev. J. Cain<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2772src" href="#xd26e2772" name=
"xd26e2772src">32</a> that, in some places, the Lamb&#257;dis fasten
rags torn from some old garment to a bush in honour of Kampalamma
(kampa, a thicket). On the side of a road from Bastar are several large
heaps of stones, which they have piled up in honour of the goddess
Guttalamma. Every Lamb&#257;di who passes the heaps is bound to place
one stone on the heap, and make a salaam to it. It is further recorded
by Mr Walhouse<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2775src" href="#xd26e2775"
name="xd26e2775src">33</a> that, when going from the Coimbatore plains
to the Mysore frontier, he saw a thorn-bush rising out of a heap of
stones piled round it, and bearing bits of rag tied to its branches by
Lamb&#257;dis. In the Telugu country, rags are offered to a god named
Pathalayya (Mr Rags). On the trunk-roads in the Nellore district, rags
may be seen hanging from the b&#257;b&#363;l (<i>Acacia arabica</i>)
trees. These are offerings made to Pathalayya by travellers, who tear
off pieces of their clothing with a vague idea that the offering
thereof will render their journey free from accidents, such as
upsetting of their carts, or meeting with robbers. Outside the temple
of the village goddess at Ojini in the Bellary district, Mr Fawcett
tells us,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2783src" href="#xd26e2783" name=
"xd26e2783src">34</a> &ldquo;are hung numbers of miniature cradles and
bangles presented by women who have borne children, or been cured of
sickness through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>the intervention of the goddess. Miniature
cows are presented by persons whose cows have been cured of sickness,
and doll-like figures for children. One sw&#257;mi (god) there is,
known by a tree hung with iron chains, hooks&mdash;anything iron;
another by rags, and so on. The ingenious dh&#333;bi (washerman), whose
function is to provide torches on occasions, sometimes practises on the
credulity of his countrymen by tying a few rags to a tree, which by and
by is covered with rags, for the passers-by are not so stiff-necked as
to ask for a sign other than a rag; and under cover of the darkness,
the dh&#333;bi makes his torch of the offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the road to the temple at Tirumala (Upper Tirupati) in the North
Arcot district, the goddess Gauthala Gangamma has her abode in a
margosa or &#257;varam (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>) tree, surrounded by a
white-ant hill. Passers-by tear off a piece of their clothing, and tie
it to the branches, and place a small stone at the base of the
ant-hill. Occasionally cooked rice is offered, fowls are sacrificed,
and their heads and legs tied to the tree. In the Madura district, bits
of rag are hung on the trees in which a deity named S&#257;tt&#257;n is
believed to reside.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2796src" href=
"#xd26e2796" name="xd26e2796src">35</a> It is noted by Mr W.
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2799src" href="#xd26e2799" name=
"xd26e2799src">36</a> that, &ldquo;in some places in the South Arcot
district, for example, on the feeder road to the Olakk&#363;r station
in Tindiv&#257;nam t&#257;luk and near the eighth mile of the road from
Kallakurchi to Vriddhachalam, are trees on which passers-by have hung
bits of rag, until they are quite covered with them. The latter of the
two cases had its origin only a few years back in the construction by
some shepherd boys of a toy temple to Gan&#275;sa formed of a few
stones under the tree, to draw attention to which they hung up a rag
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>or two. The tree is now quite covered with bits
of cloth, and beneath it is a large pile of stones, which have been
added one by one by the superstitious passers-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by the Abb&eacute; Dubois<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2806src" href="#xd26e2806" name="xd26e2806src">37</a> that
&ldquo;at Palni, in Madura, there is a famous temple consecrated to the
god Velayuda, whose devotees bring offerings of a peculiar kind, namely
large sandals, beautifully ornamented, and similar in shape to those
worn by the Hindus on their feet. The god is addicted to hunting, and
these shoes are intended for his use when he traverses the jungles and
deserts in pursuit of his favourite sport. Such shabby gifts, one might
think, would go very little way towards filling the coffers of the
priests of Velayuda. Nothing of the sort: Brahmins always know how to
reap profit from anything. Accordingly the new sandals are rubbed on
the ground and rolled a little in the dust, and are then exposed to the
eyes of the pilgrims who visit the temple. It is clear enough that the
sandals must have been worn on the divine feet of Velayuda; and they
become the property of whosoever pays the highest price for such holy
relics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Walhouse informs us<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2811src" href=
"#xd26e2811" name="xd26e2811src">38</a> that the champak and other
trees round the ancient shrine of the Trimurti at the foot of the
&#256;naimalai mountains are thickly hung with sandals and shoes, many
of huge size, evidently made for the purpose, and suspended by pilgrims
as votive offerings. The god of the temple at Tirumala is said to
appear annually to four persons in different directions, east, west,
south and north, and informs them that he requires a shoe from each of
them. They whitewash their houses, worship the god, and spread
rice-flour thickly on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>floor of a room, which is locked
for the night. Next morning the mark of a huge foot is found on the
floor, and the shoe has to be made to fit this. When ready, it is taken
in procession through the streets of the village, conveyed to Tirumala,
and presented to the temple. Though the makers of the shoes have worked
in ignorance of each others&rsquo; work, the shoes brought from the
north and south, and those from the east and west, are believed to
match and make a pair. Though the worship of these shoes is chiefly
meant for Paraiyans, who are prohibited from ascending the Tirupati
hill, as a matter of fact all, without distinction of caste, worship
them. The shoes are placed in front of the image of the god near the
foot of the hill, and are said to gradually wear away by the end of the
year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At Bel&#363;r in the Mysore Province,&rdquo; Mr
Lewis Rice writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2819src" href=
"#xd26e2819" name="xd26e2819src">39</a> &ldquo;the god of the temple is
under the necessity of making an occasional trip to the Baba Budan
hills to visit the goddess. On these occasions he is said to make use
of a large pair of slippers kept for the purpose in the temple. When
they are worn out, it devolves upon the chucklers (leather-workers) of
Channagiri and Bisvapatna, to whom the fact is revealed in a dream, to
provide new ones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to present the slippers, they are allowed to enter the
courtyard of the temple.</p>
<p>On the way leading up to the temple at Tirumala, small stones heaped
up in the form of a hearth, and knots tied in the leaves of young
date-palms may be seen. These are the work of virgins who accompany the
parties of pilgrims. The knots are tied to ensure the tying of the
marriage t&#257;li string on their necks, and the heaping up of the
stones is done with a view to ensuring the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>birth of children to them. If the girls revisit
the hill after marriage and the birth of offspring, they untie the knot
on a leaf, and disarrange one of the hearths. Men cause their name to
be cut on rocks by the wayside, or on the stones with which the path
leading to the temple is paved, in the belief that good luck will
result if their name is trodden on by some pious man.</p>
<p>At Tirupati, a number of Balijas are engaged in the red sanders
(<i>Pterocarpus santalinus</i>) wood-carving industry. Figures of
deities, mythological figures, miniature temple cars, and domestic
utensils, are among the articles turned out by them. Vessels made of
red sanders wood carry no pollution, and can be used by women during
the menstrual period, and taken back to the house without any
purification ceremony. For the same reason, Sany&#257;sis (ascetics)
use such vessels for performing worship. The carved figures are sold to
pilgrims and others who visit Tirupati, and are also taken for sale to
Conjeeveram, Madura, and other places, at times when important temple
festivals are celebrated. Carved wooden figurines, male and female,
represented in a state of nudity, are also manufactured at Tirupati,
and sold to Hindus. Those who are childless perform on them the
ear-boring ceremony, in the belief that, as the result thereof, issue
will be born to them. Or, if there are grown-up boys or girls in a
family, who remain unmarried, the parents celebrate the marriage
ceremony between a pair of figurines, in the hope that the marriage of
their children will speedily follow. They dress up the dolls in clothes
and jewelry, and go through the ceremonial of a real marriage. Some
there are who have spent as much money on a doll&rsquo;s wedding as on
a wedding in real life.</p>
<p>The simplest form of offerings consists of fruits, such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>as
plantains and cocoanuts. Without an offering of fruit no orthodox Hindu
would think of entering a temple, or coming into the presence of a
Native of position. The procession of servants and retainers, each
bringing a gift of a lime fruit, on New Year&rsquo;s Day is familiar to
Anglo-Indians. By the rules of Government, framed with a view to
preventing bribery, the prohibition of the receipt of presents from
Native Chiefs and others does not extend to the receipt of a few
flowers or fruits, and articles of inappreciable value, although even
such trifling presents should be discouraged.</p>
<p>As a thanksgiving for recovery from illness, votive offerings
frequently take the form of silver or gold representations of the part
of the body affected, which are deposited in a vessel kept for the
purpose at the temple. They are kept for sale in the vicinity of the
temple, and must be offered by the person who has taken the vow, or on
whose behalf it has been taken. When a person has been ill all over, a
silver human figure, or a thin silver wire of the same length as
himself, and representing him, is sometimes offered.</p>
<p>Of silver offerings from temples in the Tamil country, the Madras
Museum possesses an extensive collection, in which are included the
face, hands, feet, buttocks, tongue, larynx, navel, nose, ears, eyes,
breasts, genitalia, etc.; snakes offered to propitiate the anger of
serpents, snakes coiled <i>in coitu</i>, sandals, flags, umbrellas, and
cocoanuts strung on a pole.</p>

<p>When litigation arises in Malabar in connection with the title to a
house and compound (grounds) in which it stands, a vow is sometimes
made to offer a silver model representing the property, if a favourable
decree is obtained. Some time ago, a rich landlord offered at the
temple a silver model representing the exact number of trees, house,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>well, etc., and costing several hundreds of
rupees, when a suit was decided in his favour.</p>
<p>In connection with the temple at Guruvay&#363;r in Malabar, Mr
Fawcett writes as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2859src" href=
"#xd26e2859" name="xd26e2859src">40</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I visited the festival on one occasion, and
purchase was made of a few offerings such as are made to the temple in
satisfaction of vows&mdash;a very rude representation of an infant in
silver, a hand, a leg, an ulcer, a pair of eyes, and, most curious of
all, a silver string which represents a man, the giver. Goldsmiths
working in silver and gold are to be seen just outside the gate of the
temple, ready to provide at a moment&rsquo;s notice the object that any
person intends to offer, in case he is not already in possession of his
votive offering.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A N&#257;yar examined by Mr Fawcett was wearing a silver ring as a
vow, which was to be given up at the next festival at Kotti&#363;r in
North Malabar. Another was wearing a silver bangle. He had a wound in
his arm which was long in healing, so he made a vow to the god at
Tirupati (Tirumala) that, if his arm was healed, he would give up the
bangle at the temple.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a shrine was erected at Cochin for a picture of the
Virgin and Child, which attained to great celebrity for its power of
working miracles. &ldquo;Many stories,&rdquo; Mr Fawcett
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2872src" href="#xd26e2872" name=
"xd26e2872src">41</a> &ldquo;of the power of the picture are current. A
fisherman, who had lost his nets, vowed to give a little net, if they
were found. The votive offerings, which are sometimes of copper or
brass, take strange forms. There are fishes, prawns, rice, cocoanut
trees, cows, etc. A little silver model of a bridge was given by a
contractor, who vowed, when he found his foundations were shaky, to
give it if his work should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>pass muster. The power of the
picture is such that the votaries are not confined to the Christian
community. There are among them many Hindus and Mahomedans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In South Canara, silver rats and pigs are offered to protect the
crops from destruction by these animals. Silver rice-grains are offered
when children do not take their food properly, and silver sheaves of
grain if the crop is abundant. At Pyka, brass or clay figures of the
tiger, leopard, elephant, wild boar, and bandicoot rat, are presented
at the shrine of a female bh&#363;tha<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2882src" href="#xd26e2882" name="xd26e2882src">42</a> named
Poomanikunhoomani, to protect the crops and cattle from the ravages of
these animals. The figures must be solid, as the bh&#363;thas would be
very angry if they were hollow. A brass figure of Sarabha, a
mythological eight-legged animal, which is supposed to be the vehicle
of the god V&#299;rabhadra, is presented as an offering to some Siva
temples in South Canara in cases where a person is attacked with a form
of ulcer known as Siva&rsquo;s ulcer. Sometimes a silver lizard is
offered at temples, to counteract the evils which would result from a
lizard falling on some unlucky part of the body, such as the kudumi
(hair knot) of a female. The lizard, associated with the name of Siva,
is regarded as sacred. It is never intentionally killed, and, if
accidentally hurt or killed, an image of it in gold or silver is
presented by high caste Hindus to a Siva temple.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In Malabar, a Br&#257;hman magician transfers the spirits of those
who have died an unnatural death to images made of gold, silver, or
wood, which are placed in a temple or special building erected for
them. It is said by Mr F. Fawcett, &ldquo;to be a sacred duty to a
deceased Tiyan in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163"
name="pb163">163</a>]</span>Malabar, who was of importance, for
example, the head of a family, to have a silver image of him made, and
arrange for it being deposited in some temple, where it will receive
its share of worship, and offerings of food and water. The temples at
Tirunelli in Wyn&#257;d and Tirunavayi, which are among the oldest in
Malabar, were generally the resting-places of these images, but now
some of the well-to-do deposit them much further afield, even at
Benares and R&#257;m&#275;svaram. A silver image is presented to the
local Siva temple, where, for a consideration, worship is done every
new moon day. On each of these days, mantrams are supposed to be
repeated a thousand times. When the image has been the object of these
mantrams sixteen thousand times, it is supposed to have become eligible
for final deposit at Tirunavayi or elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a Muhammadan suffers from severe pain in the hand or foot, a vow
is sometimes taken to the effect that a silver hand or foot will be
taken to the grave of some saint, and put into the treasury which is
kept there to meet the expenses of the annual ceremonies of the saint.
At Vizagapatam<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2901src" href="#xd26e2901"
name="xd26e2901src">44</a> there is a celebrated Muhammadan saint, who
lies buried by the Durga on the top of the hill overlooking the
harbour. He is considered to be all potent over the elements of the Bay
of Bengal, and many a silver dhoni (native boat) is presented at his
shrine by Hindu ship-owners after a successful voyage. A suit once
arose between a K&#333;mati boat-owner and his Muhammadan captain
during settlement of the accounts. The captain stated that, during a
storm off the coast of Arakan, he had vowed a purse of rupees to the
saint, and had duly presented it on his return. This sum he charged to
the owner of the vessel, whose sole contention was that the vow had
never been discharged; the propriety <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>of conciliating the
saint in a hurricane he allowed. At Timmancherla in the Anantapur
district there is a tomb of a holy Muhammadan named Masthan Ali, in
whose honour a religious ceremony is held annually in April, which is
attended by both Muhammadans and Hindus. The latter make vows at the
tomb, which has a special reputation for granting offspring to the
childless. The headman of the village, who is a Hindu, brings the first
offerings in procession with much ceremony.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2906src" href="#xd26e2906" name="xd26e2906src">45</a></p>
<p>At the annual festival at the temple at Nedamangad in Travancore,
which is attended by large numbers of the lower classes, the
worshippers are said by the Rev. S. Mateer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2911src" href="#xd26e2911" name="xd26e2911src">46</a> to
&ldquo;bring with them wooden models of cows covered, in imitation of
shaggy hair, with ears of rice. Many of these images are brought, each
in a separate procession from its own place. The headmen are finely
dressed with cloths stained purple at the edge. The image is borne on a
bamboo frame, accompanied by a drum,&rdquo; and carried round the
temple. The Gudigars (wood-carvers) at Udipi in South Canara make
life-size wooden buffaloes and large human figures as votive offerings
for the Iswara Temple at Hiriadk&#257;p, where they are set up in a
row. By the Savaras of Vizagapatam, rudely carved and grotesque wooden
representations of human beings, monkeys, lizards, parrots, peacocks,
guns, pickaxes, daggers, etc., are dedicated to the tribal deity. They
would not sell them to the district officer who acquired them on my
behalf, but parted with them on the understanding that they would be
worshipped by the Sirkar (Government). In like manner, the fishermen of
the Ganjam coast objected to specimens of the gods which are placed in
little shrines on the sea-shore being sent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>to
me, till they were told that it was because the Government had heard of
their devotion to their gods that they wanted to have some of them in
Madras. The gods, which are made in clay and wood, include Bengali
B&#257;bu riding on a black horse, who is believed to bless the
fishermen, secure large hauls of fish for them, and protect them
against danger when out fishing. It has been observed that this
affinity between the Ganjam fishermen and the Bengali B&#257;bu,
resulting in the apotheosis of the latter, is certainly a striking
example of the catholicity of hero-worship, and it would be interesting
to know how long, and for what reasons the conception of protection has
appealed to the followers of the piscatory industry. It was Sir George
Campbell, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who compelled his Bengali
officials, much against their inclination, to cultivate the art of
equitation.</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr G. V. Ramamurthi Pantulu that the Savaras attend
the markets or fairs held in the plains, or at the foot of the
gh&#257;ts, to purchase salt and other articles. If a Savara is taken
ill at the market or on his return thence, he attributes the illness to
a spirit of the market called Biradi Sonum. The bulls which carry the
goods of the Hindu merchants to the market are supposed to convey the
spirit. In propitiating it, the Savara makes an image of a bull in
straw, and, taking it out of his village, leaves it on the footpath,
after a pig has been sacrificed. Owners of cattle take the animals when
sick round the sacred hill at Tirukazhukunram in performance of a vow,
in the belief that their health will be thus restored.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A Br&#257;hmini bull,&rdquo; Mr A. Srinivasan
writes, &ldquo;is dedicated to the god Venkat&#275;swara of Tirupati,
for the benefit of the living in fulfilment of vows. The act of
dedication and release is preceded by elaborate rituals <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>of
marriage, as among men and women. The bride, which should be a heifer
that has not calved, is furnished by the father-in-law of the donor.
The heifer is united in holy wedlock to the bullock, after formal
chanting of mantrams, by the tying of the t&#257;li and toe-rings to
the neck. In this sham marriage, the profuse ornamentation of the
couple with saffron (turmeric) and red powder, the pouring of rice on
their heads, and a procession through the streets with music, are
conspicuous features.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am told that, if the devotee cannot afford a live animal, a mimic
representative is made in rice.</p>
<p>Painted hollow images are made by special families of Kusavans
(potters) known as p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest), who, for the privilege of
making them, have to pay an annual fee to the headman, who spends it on
a festival at the caste temple. When a married couple are anxious to
have female offspring, they take a vow to offer figures of the seven
virgins (Saptha Kannimar), who are represented all seated in a row. If
a male or female recovers from cholera, smallpox, or other severe
illness, a figure of the corresponding sex is offered. A childless
woman makes a vow to offer up the figure of a baby, if she brings forth
offspring. Figures of animals&mdash;cattle, horses, sheep,
etc.&mdash;are offered at the temple when they recover from sickness,
or are recovered after they have been stolen. Horses made of clay,
painted red and other colours, are set up in the fields to drive away
demons, or as a thank-offering for recovery from sickness, or any piece
of good luck. The villagers erect these horses in honour of the popular
deity Ayanar, the guardian deity of the fields, who is a renowned
huntsman, and is believed, when, with his wives Purna and Pushkala, he
visits the village at night, to mount the horses, and ride down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>the demons. Ayanar is said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2931src" href="#xd26e2931" name="xd26e2931src">47</a> to be the
special deity of the Kusavan caste. Kusavans are generally the
p&#363;j&#257;ris at his temples, and they make the earthenware, and
brick and mortar horses and images, which are placed before these
buildings. The pupils of the eyes of the various images are not painted
in till they are taken to the temple, where offerings of fruit, etc.,
are first made. Even the pupils of a series of images which were
specially made for me were not painted at the potter&rsquo;s house, but
in the verandah of the traveller&rsquo;s bungalow where I was staying.
A very interesting account of the n&#275;tra mangalya, or ceremony of
painting the eyes of images, as performed by craftsmen in Ceylon, has
been published by Mr A. K. Coomaraswamy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2934src" href="#xd26e2934" name="xd26e2934src">48</a> Therein he
writes that &ldquo;by far the most important ceremony connected with
the building and decoration of a vih&#257;ra (temple), or with its
renovation, was the actual <i>netra mangalya</i> or eye ceremonial. The
ceremony had to be performed in the case of any image, whether set up
in a vih&#257;ra or not. Even in the case of flat paintings it was
necessary. D. S. Muhandiram, when making for me a book of drawings of
gods according to the R&#363;pavaliya, left the eyes to be subsequently
inserted on an auspicious occasion, with some simpler form of the
ceremony described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this subject, Knox writes as follows<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2942src" href="#xd26e2942" name="xd26e2942src">49</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Some, being devoutly disposed, will make the
image of this god (Buddha) at their own charge. For the making whereof
they must bountifully reward the Founder. Before the eyes are made, it
is not accounted a god, but a lump of ordinary metal, and thrown about
the shop with no more regard than anything else. But, when the eyes are
to be made, the artificer is to have a good gratification, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>besides the first agreed upon reward. The eyes
being formed, it is thenceforward a god. And then, being brought with
honour from the workman&rsquo;s shop, it is dedicated by solemnities
and sacrifices, and carried with great state into the shrine or little
house, which is before built and prepared for it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting money into a receptacle (undi) as an offering to a
particular deity is a very common custom. In the case of a popular god,
such as the one at Tirumala, an earthen pot is sometimes replaced by a
copper money-box or iron safe. In South Canara there was a well-to-do
family, the members of which kept on depositing coins in the family
undi, which were set apart for the Tirumala god during a number of
generations. Not only in cases of sickness, but even when a member of
the family went to a neighbouring village, and returned safely, a few
coins were put into the undi. For some reason, the opening of the undi,
and offering of its contents at Tirumala, was postponed, and, when it
was finally opened, it was found to contain a miscellaneous collection
of coins, current and uncurrent. When a temple is far away, and those
who wish to make offerings thereat cannot, owing to the expense of the
journey or other reason, go there themselves, the offerings are taken
by a substitute. If the god to whom the offering is made is
Sriniv&#257;sa of Tirumala, a small sum of money must be offered as
compensation for not taking it in person. The god is sometimes called
Vaddi K&#257;sulu Varu, in allusion to the money (k&#257;su) or
interest. In some large towns, in the months of July and August,
parties of devotees may be seen wandering about the streets, and
collecting offerings to the god, which will be presented to him in due
course. If a Kelasi (barber) in South Canara is seriously ill, he
sometimes undertakes a vow to beg from door to door, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>and
convey the money thus collected to Tirumala. In his house he keeps a
small closed box with a slit in the lid, through which he drops a coin
at every stroke of misfortune, and the contents are eventually sent to
the holy shrine.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2955src" href="#xd26e2955"
name="xd26e2955src">50</a> A few years ago, a Native complained to the
police that about seven hundred rupees had been stolen from some brass
pots, which he kept in a separate room of his house. The money, he
stated, was dedicated to the Tirumula temple, and was kept in the pots
buried in paddy (unhusked rice). He himself had put in about fifty
rupees during the time that the pots had been in his charge, either as
an annual contribution, or on occasions of sickness. His mother stated
that it had been a custom in the family to put money into the vessel
for several generations, and she had never seen the pots opened.</p>
<p>It is whispered that Kallan dacoits invoke the aid of their deity
Alagarsw&#257;mi, when they are setting out on marauding expeditions,
and, if they are successful therein, put part of their ill-gotten gains
into the offertory box, which is kept at his shrine.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2963src" href="#xd26e2963" name="xd26e2963src">51</a> In this
connection, the Rev. J. Sharrock states that &ldquo;there is an
understanding that, if their own village gods help them in their
thefts, they are to have a fair share of the spoil, and, on the
principle of honour among thieves, the bargain is always kept. When
strange deities are met with on their thieving expeditions, it is usual
to make a vow that, if the adventure turns out well, part of the spoil
shall next day be left at the shrine of the god, or be handed over to
the puj&#257;ri of that particular deity. They are afraid that, if this
precaution be not taken, the god may make them blind, or cause them to
be discovered, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>may go so far as to knock them down, and
leave them to bleed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most popular of the Muhammadan saints who are buried at Porto
Novo, where a considerable number of Marakk&#257;yars (Muhammadans) are
engaged as sailors,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;is one M&#257;lumiyar, who was apparently in
his lifetime a notable sea-captain. His fame as a sailor has been
magnified into the miraculous, and it is declared that he owned ten or
a dozen ships, and used to appear in command of all of them
simultaneously. He has now the reputation of being able to deliver from
danger those who go down to the sea in ships, and sailors setting out
on a voyage, or returning from one in safety, usually put an offering
in the little box kept at his darga, and these sums are expended in
keeping that building lighted and whitewashed. Another curious darga in
the town is that of Araik&#257;su N&#257;chiyar, or the one pie lady.
Offerings to her must on no account be worth more than one pie
(&#8203;1&frasl;192 of a rupee); tributes in excess of that value are
of no effect. If sugar for so small an amount cannot be procured, the
devotee spends the money on chunam (lime) for her tomb, and this is
consequently covered with a superabundance of whitewash. Stories are
told of the way in which the valuable offerings of rich men have
altogether failed to obtain her favour, and have had to be replaced by
others of the regulation diminutive dimensions.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>The chief god of the D&#333;mbs of Vizagapatam is said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2978src" href="#xd26e2978" name=
"xd26e2978src">53</a> to be represented by a pie piece placed in or
over a new earthen pot smeared with rice and turmeric powder. It is
said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2984src" href="#xd26e2984" name=
"xd26e2984src">54</a> that Muhammadans, belonging to the lower classes,
consult panch&#257;ngam Br&#257;hmans about the chances of success in
their enterprises. Some of these Br&#257;hmans <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>send
half the fee so obtained to the Muhammadan mosque at Nag&#363;r near
Negapatam, and will even offer sugar and flowers at that shrine, though
they endeavour to excuse the act by saying that the saint was
originally a Br&#257;hman.</p>
<p>I once saw a Muhammadan at Tumkur in Mysore, whither he had
journeyed from Hyderabad, who had a rupee tied round his arm in token
of a vow that, if he returned safe from plague and other ills to his
own country, he would give money in charity. When a Muhammadan falls
ill, a rupee and a quarter is sometimes done up in a red cloth, and
tied round the arm, to be given to the poor on recovery. Members of the
poorer classes tie an anna and a quarter in like manner, after
performing a fateha ceremony. Should the sickness of a Hindu be
attributed to a god or goddess, a vow is made, in token whereof a
copper or silver coin is wrapped up in a piece of cloth dipped in
turmeric paste, and kept in the house, or tied to the neck or arm of
the sick person. A cock may be waved round the head of the patient, and
afterwards reared in the house, to be eventually offered up at the
shrine of the deity. A B&#275;dar, whom I saw at Hospet in the Bellary
district, had a quarter anna rolled up in cotton cloth, which he wore
on the upper arm in performance of a vow.</p>
<p>In an account of the cock festival at Cranganore in Malabar, whereat
vast numbers of cocks are sacrificed, Mr Gopal Panikkar
records<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2993src" href="#xd26e2993" name=
"xd26e2993src">55</a> that, &ldquo;when a man is taken ill of any
infectious disease, his relations generally pray to the goddess (at
Cranganore) for his recovery, solemnly covenanting to perform what goes
by the name of a thulabh&#257;ram (or thulupurushad&#257;nam)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2996src" href="#xd26e2996" name=
"xd26e2996src">56</a> ceremony. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172"
href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>This consists in placing the
patient in one of the scale-pans of a huge balance, and weighing him
against gold, or, more generally, pepper (and sometimes other
substances), deposited in the other scale-pan. Then this weight of the
substance is offered to the goddess. This has to be performed right in
front of the goddess in the temple yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Mulki in South Canara there is a temple of Venkat&#275;swara,
which is maintained by Konkani Br&#257;hmans. A Konkani Br&#257;hman,
who is attached to the temple, becomes inspired almost daily between 10
and 11 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, immediately after worship, and
people consult him. Some time ago, a rich merchant from Gujarat
consulted the inspired man as to what steps should be taken to enable
his wife to be safely delivered. He was told to take a vow that he
would present to the god of the temple, silver, sugar-candy, and date
fruits, equal in weight to that of his wife<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3006" title="Source: ,">.</span> This he did, and his wife was
delivered of a male child. The cost of the ceremonial is said to have
been five thousand rupees. In the thulabh&#257;ram ceremony as
performed by the Mah&#257;r&#257;jas of Travancore,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3009src" href="#xd26e3009" name="xd26e3009src">57</a> they are
weighed against gold coins, called thulabh&#257;ra k&#257;su, specially
struck for the occasion, which are divided among the priests who
performed the ceremony, and Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>The following quaint custom, which is observed at the village of
Pullambadi in the Trichinopoly district, is described by Bishop
Whitehead.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3016src" href="#xd26e3016" name=
"xd26e3016src">58</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The goddess Kulanthal Amman has established for
herself a useful reputation as a settler of debts. When a creditor
cannot recover a debt, he writes down his claim on a scroll of
palm-leaves, and offers the goddess a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>part of the debt, if
it is paid. The palmyra scroll is hung up on an iron spear in the
compound of the temple before the shrine. If the claim is just, and the
debtor does not pay, it is believed that he will be afflicted with
sickness and bad dreams. In his dreams he will be told to pay the debt
at once, if he wishes to be freed from his misfortunes. If, however,
the debtor disputes the claim, he draws up a counter-statement, and
hangs it on the same spear. Then the deity decides which claim is true,
and afflicts with sickness and bad dreams the man whose claim is false.
When a claim is acknowledged, the debtor brings the money, and gives it
to the p&#363;j&#257;ri, who places it before the image of Kulanthal
Amman, and sends word to the creditor. The whole amount is then handed
over to the creditor, who pays the sum vowed to the goddess into the
temple coffers in April or May. So great is the reputation of the
goddess, that Hindus come from about ten miles round to seek her aid in
recovering their debts. The goddess may sometimes make mistakes, but,
at any rate, it is cheaper than an appeal to an ordinary court of law,
and probably almost as effective as a means of securing justice. In
former times, no written statements were presented; people simply came
and represented their claims by word of mouth to the deity, promising
to give her a share. The custom of presenting written claims sprang up
about thirty years ago, doubtless through the influence of the Civil
Courts. Apparently more debts have been collected since this was done,
and more money has been gathered into the treasury.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noted by the Rev. A. Marg&ouml;schis<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3030src" href="#xd26e3030" name="xd26e3030src">59</a> that
&ldquo;the Hindus observe a special day at the commencement of the
palmyra season (in Tinnevelly), when the jaggery season begins. Bishop
Caldwell adopted the custom, and a solemn service in church was held,
when one set <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>of all the implements used in the occupation of
palmyra-climbing was brought to the church, and presented at the altar.
Only the day was changed from that observed by the Hindus. The perils
of the palmyra-climber are great, and there are many fatal accidents by
falling from trees forty to sixty feet high, so that a religious
service of the kind was particularly acceptable and peculiarly
appropriate to our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story is told by Bishop Caldwell of a Sh&#257;nar (toddy-drawer)
who was sitting upon a leaf-stalk at the top of a palmyra palm in a
high wind, when the stalk gave way, and he came down to the ground
safely and quietly sitting on the leaf, which served the purpose of a
natural parachute.</p>
<p>The festival of Ayudha P&#363;ja (worship of tools or implements) is
observed by all Hindu castes during the last three days of the Dasara
or Navarathri in the month of Purattasi (September-October). It is a
universal holiday for all Hindu workmen. Even the Br&#257;hman takes
part in this p&#363;ja. His tools, however, being books, it is called
Saraswati p&#363;ja, or worship to the goddess or god of learning, who
is either Saraswati or Hayagriva. Reading books and repetition of
V&#275;das must be done, and, for the purpose of worship, all the books
in a house are piled up in a heap. Non-Br&#257;hmans clean the various
implements used by them in their daily work, and worship them. The
Kamm&#257;lans (artisans) clean their hammers, pincers, anvil,
blowpipe, etc.; the Chettis (merchants) clean their scales and weights,
and the box into which they put their money. The racket-marker at the
Madras Club decorates the entrance to the scoring-box in which his
rackets are kept, with a festoon of mango leaves. The weaving and
agricultural classes will be seen to be busy with their looms and
agricultural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>implements. Fishermen pile up their nets for
worship. Even the bandywala (cart-driver) paints red and white stripes
on the wheels and axles. I have myself been profusely garlanded when
present as a guest at the elaborate tool-worshipping ceremony at the
Madras School of Arts, where p&#363;ja was done to a bust of the late
Bishop Gell set up on an improvised altar, with a cast of Saraswati
above, and various members of the Hindu Pantheon around.</p>
<p>At the festival held by the Koyis of the God&#257;vari district in
propitiation of a goddess called Pida, very frequently offerings
promised long before are sacrificed, and eaten by the puj&#257;ri. It
is not at all uncommon for a Koyi to promise to offer a seven-horned
male (<i>i.e.</i> a cock) as a bribe to be let alone, a two-horned male
(<i>i.e.</i> a goat) being set apart by more wealthy or more fervent
suppliants.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3049src" href="#xd26e3049" name=
"xd26e3049src">60</a> When smallpox or other epidemic disease breaks
out in a Gadaba village in Vizagapatam, a little go-cart on wheels is
constructed. In this a clay image, or anything else holy, is placed,
and it is taken to a distant spot, and left there. It is also the
custom, when cholera or smallpox is epidemic in the same district, to
make a little car, &ldquo;on which are placed a grain of
saffron-stained<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3055src" href="#xd26e3055"
name="xd26e3055src">61</a> rice for every soul in the village, and
numerous offerings such as little swings, pots, knives, ploughs, and
the like, and the blood of certain sacrificial victims, and this is
then dragged with due ceremony to the boundary of the village. By this
means the malignant essence of the deity who brings smallpox or cholera
is transferred across the boundary. The neighbouring villagers
naturally hasten to move the car on with similar ceremony, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>it is thus dragged through a whole series of
villages, and eventually left by the roadside in some lonely
spot.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3067src" href="#xd26e3067"

<p>Marching on one occasion, towards Hampi in the Bellary district,
where an outbreak of cholera had recently occurred, I came across two
wooden gods on wheels by the roadside, to whom had been offered baskets
of fruit, vegetables, earthen pots, bead necklets, and bangles, which
were piled up in front of them. It is recorded<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3072src" href="#xd26e3072" name="xd26e3072src">63</a> by Bishop
Whitehead that, when an epidemic breaks out in a certain village in the
Telugu country,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;the headman of the village gets a new
earthenware pot, besmears it with turmeric and kunkuma (red powder),
and puts inside it some clay bracelets, necklaces, and earrings, three
pieces of charcoal, three pieces of turmeric, three pieces of incense,
a piece of dried cocoanut, a woman&rsquo;s cloth, and two annas worth
of coppers&mdash;a strange collection of miscellaneous charms and
offerings. The pot is then hung up on a tree near the image of the
village deity, as a pledge that, if the epidemic disappears, the people
will celebrate a festival.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is further recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3083src" href=
"#xd26e3083" name="xd26e3083src">64</a> by Bishop Whitehead that,
during the festival of M&#257;riamma at Kannanur in the Trichinopoly
district, &ldquo;many people who have made vows bring sheep, goats,
fowls, pigeons, parrots, cows, and calves, to the temple, and leave
them in the compound alive. At the end of the festival, these animals
are all sold to a contractor. Two years ago, they fetched Rs.
400&mdash;a good haul for the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the Madras museum and the Government <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>maternity hospital, a small municipal boundary
stone has been set up by the side of the road. To this stone
supernatural powers are attributed, and it is alleged that in a banyan
tree in a private garden close by a M&#363;ni lives, who presides over
the welfare of the patients in the hospital, and must be propitiated if
the pregnant woman is to get over her confinement without
complications. Women vow that they will, if all goes well, give a
cocoanut, betel, or flowers when they leave. Discharged patients can be
seen daily, going to the stone and making offerings. On the day of
their discharge, their friends bring camphor and other articles, and
the whole family goes to the stone, where the camphor is burnt, a
cocoanut broken, and perhaps some turmeric or flowers placed on it. The
new-born child is placed on the bare ground in front of the stone, and
the mother, kneeling down, bows before it. The foreheads of both mother
and child are marked with the soots from the burning camphor. If her
friends do not bring the requisite articles, the woman goes home, and
returns with them to do p&#363;ja to the stone, or it is celebrated at
a temple or her house. The offerings are removed by those who present
them, or by passers-by on the road.</p>
<p>The Kudubi cutch (catechu) makers of South Canara, before the
commencement of operations, select an <i>Areca Catechu</i> tree, and
place a sword, an axe, and a cocoanut on the ground near it. They
prostrate themselves before the tree, with hands uplifted, burn
incense, and break cocoanuts. The success of the operations is believed
to depend on the good-will of a deity named Sidd&#275;d&#275;varu.
Before they commence work, the Kudubis make a vow that, if they are
successful, they will offer a fowl.</p>

<p>On the Rangasv&#257;mi peak on the N&#299;lgiris are two rude walled
enclosures sacred to the god Ranga and his consort, within which are
deposited various offerings, chiefly iron lamps and the notched sticks

tribesman).<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3108src" href="#xd26e3108" name=

Travancore hills as shrines, wherein spear-heads, tridents, and copper

<p>Prehistoric stone cells, found in the bed of a river, are believed
to be the thunderbolts of Vishnu, and are stacked as offerings by the
Malai&#257;lis of the Shevaroy hills in their shrines dedicated to

cut in rocks.</p>
<p>Of a remarkable form of demon worship in Tinnevelly, Bishop Caldwell
wrote that<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3115src" href="#xd26e3115" name=
"xd26e3115src">67</a> &ldquo;an European was till recently worshipped
as a demon. From the rude verses which were sung in connection with his
worship, it would appear that he was an English officer, who was
mortally wounded at the taking of the Travancore lines in 1809, and was
buried about twenty-five miles from the scene of the battle in a sandy
waste, where, a few years ago, his worship was established by the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns of the neighbourhood. His worship consisted in the
offering to his manes of spirituous liquors and cheroots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A similar form of worship, or propitiation of demons, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>is
recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3123src" href="#xd26e3123" name=
"xd26e3123src">68</a> by Bishop Whitehead from Malabar. He was told
that &ldquo;the spirits of the old Portuguese soldiers and traders are
still propitiated on the coast with offerings of toddy and cheroots.
The spirits are called K&#257;ppiri (probably Kaffirs or foreigners).
This superstition is dying out, but is said to be common among the
fishermen of the French settlement of Mai (Mah&eacute;).&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion, a man who had been presented with two annas as the
fee for lending his body to me for measurement, offered it, with
flowers and a cocoanut, at the shrine of the village goddess, and
dedicated to her another coin of his own as a peace-offering, and to
get rid of the pollution caused by my money. <span class=

wild pigs from the fields, and warding off cattle disease. For the last
purpose, the magical formula is carved on a stone pillar, which is set
up in the village. They are divided into four classes, viz.,
mantrasara, or the real essence of magic; yantrasara, or the science of
cabalistic figures; prayogasara, or the method of using these for the
attainment of any object; tantrasara, or the science of symbolical acts
with or without words.</p>
<p>Mantrasara includes all mantrams, with their efficacy for good and
evil, and the methods of learning and reciting them with the aid of a
guru (spiritual preceptor). They are said to be effective only when the
individual who resorts to them is pure in mind and body. This can be
attained by the recitation of ajapagayithri (216,000 inhalations and
exhalations in twenty-four hours). These have to be divided among the
deities Gan&#275;sa, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, J&#299;vathma, Paramathma,
and the guru, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>in the proportion of 600, 6000, 6000, 6000,
1000, 1000, 1000. A man can only become learned in mantrams
(mantrav&#257;di) by the regular performance of the recognised
ceremonial, by proper recital of the mantrams, by burning the sacred
fire, and by taking food. A Lamb&#257;di has been seen repeating
mantrams over his patients, and touching their heads at the same time
with a book, which was a small edition of the Telugu translation of St
John&rsquo;s gospel. Neither the physician nor the patient could read,
and had no idea of the contents of the book.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3145src" href="#xd26e3145" name="xd26e3145src">1</a> It is noted
by the Abb&eacute; Dubois,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3148src" href=
"#xd26e3148" name="xd26e3148src">2</a> that one of the principal
reasons why so little confidence is placed in European doctors by
Hindus is that, when administering their remedies, they recite neither
mantrams nor prayers.</p>
<p>Yantrasara includes all cabalistic figures, the method of drawing
and using them, and the objects to be attained by them. They are
usually drawn on thin plates of gold, silver, copper, or lead. The
efficacy of the figures, when drawn on gold, will, it is said, last for
a century, while those drawn on the less precious metals will only be
effective for six months or a year. Leaden plates are used when the
yantrams are to be buried underground. The figures should possess the
symbols of life, the eyes, tongue, eight cardinal points of the
compass, and the five elements.</p>
<p>Prayogasara includes attraction or summoning by enchantment, driving
out evil spirits, stupefaction, tempting or bringing a deity or evil
spirits under control, and enticement for love, destruction, and the
separation of friends.</p>
<p>The following are examples of cases in which a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>European, who, having been trained by a guru,
was well versed in the theory and practice of native magic, was called
in to administer to Natives, who were under the spell of devils. In the
first case, a Telugu girl, about seventeen years old, had been for some
time possessed by her sister&rsquo;s husband, under whose influence she
used to eat abnormal quantities of food, tear off her clothes, and use
indecent language in a voice other than her own. When the European
arrived in her room, the devil, speaking through the girl, threatened
to kill her, or the European, or the individual who put it into her.
Under the spell of a suitable mantram, the devil departed, and its
return was prevented by the wearing of a yantram. The other case was
that of a boy, who was possessed by a devil. He was found, on the
occasion of the visit of the European, lying down in the courtyard of
his house, clad in an ample loin-cloth, and with a high temperature.
Suddenly, through some invisible agency, a corner of his loin-cloth
caught fire, which was stamped out. It then caught fire in another
place, and eventually was riddled with burnt holes. This was the way in
which the devil manifested its influence, and sometimes the boy got
burnt. A mantram was recited, with the result that the burning ceased,
and the fever abated. An impromptu yantram was made out of vibh&#363;ti
(sacred ashes), and tied round the boy&rsquo;s neck. A religious
mendicant came along a short time afterwards, and treated the boy for
some ordinary sickness not connected with the devil, but the medicine
did him no good. Finding the yantram round his neck, the mendicant
asserted that it was the cause of his failure, and ordered its removal.
This the boy&rsquo;s relations refused to permit. But the holy man
ripped it off. Whereon the boy instantly fell down comatose. In
recording these two cases, I have reproduced my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>notes made on the occasion of an interview with
the European.</p>
<p>Reference has been made (p. 180) to mantrams carved on stone
pillars. The story of a stone slab at R&#257;yalcheruvu in the
Anantapur district, known as the yantram r&#257;yi or magic stone, is
narrated by Mr Francis.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3163src" href=
"#xd26e3163" name="xd26e3163src">3</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The charm consists of eighty-one squares, nine
each way, within a border of tridents. Each square contains one or more
Telugu letters, but these will not combine into any intelligible words.
At the bottom of the stone are cut a lingam and two pairs of
foot-prints. Some twelve years ago, it is said, the village suffered
severely from cholera for three years in succession, and a Telugu
mason, a foreigner who was in the village at the time, cut this charm
on the stone to stop the disease. It was set up with much ceremony. The
mason went round the village at night without a stitch of clothing on
him, and with the entrails of a sheep hanging round his neck. Many
cocoanuts were offered to the stone, and many sheep slain before it.
The mason tossed a lamb in the air, caught it as it fell, tore its
throat open with his teeth, and then bounded forward, and spat out the
blood. More sheep and cocoanuts were offered, and then the slab was set
up. The mason naturally demanded a substantial return for the benefit
he had conferred on the inhabitants. When cholera now breaks out, the
villagers subscribe together, and do <i>p&#363;ja</i> (worship) to the
stone in accordance with directions left by him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of similar stones in the South Arcot district, Mr Francis writes as
follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3175src" href="#xd26e3175" name=
"xd26e3175src">4</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In several villages in the west of the district
are magical slabs, which are supposed to cure cholera and cattle
disease. On them, surrounded by a border of trisulas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>(the
trident of Siva) are cut a series of little squares, in each of which
is some Tamil letter. The villagers usually explain their existence by
saying that, some forty years ago, an ascetic, whom they call the
sangili (chain) sany&#257;si from his predilection for wearing red-hot
chains round his neck, came there when cholera and cattle disease were
rife, and (for a consideration) put up these slabs to ward off his
ills. He left directions that, when either disease reappeared, 108 pots
of water were to be poured over the slab, 108 bilva (<i>&AElig;gle
Marmelos</i>) leaves tied to it and so on, and that men and animals
were then to walk through the water which had been poured over
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Francis writes further<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3189src" href=
"#xd26e3189" name="xd26e3189src">5</a> that &ldquo;in many places,
stone slabs may be seen set up in the outskirts of the villages, on
what are said to be the old boundaries. These are thought to be able to
ward off sickness, and other harm which threatens to enter the place,
and are revered accordingly. Some are quite blank, others have letters
cut on them, while others again bear the rude outline of a deity, and
are accordingly given such names as Pid&#257;ri or Ellai Amman (the
goddess of the boundary). To these last, periodical worship is often
performed, but, in the case of the others, the attentions of the
villagers are confined to an annual ceremony, whereat cocoanuts are
broken, camphor is burnt, and a light is placed on the
stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was noted by Lieutenant R. F. Burton<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3202src" href="#xd26e3202" name="xd26e3202src">6</a> that, in
some hamlets, the Kotas of the N&#299;lgiris have set up curiously
carved stones, which they consider sacred, and attribute to them the
power of curing diseases, if the member affected is rubbed against
them. At cross-roads in Bellary, odd geometric patterns may sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>be noticed. These are put there at night by
people suffering from disease, in the hope that the affliction will
pass to the person who first treads on the charm.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3207src" href="#xd26e3207" name="xd26e3207src">7</a></p>
<p>As examples of yantrams, the following, selected from a very large
repertoire, may be cited:&mdash;</p>
<p>Ganapathi yantram should be drawn on metal, and worship performed.
It is then enclosed in a metal cylinder, and tied by a thread round the
neck of females, or the waist or arm of men. It will cure disease,
conquer an enemy, or entice any one. If the sacred fire is kept up
while the formula is being repeated, and dry cocoanut, plantain fruits,
money, gh&#299; (clarified butter), and sweet bread put into it, the
owner will be blessed with wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>Bhadrak&#257;li yantram. The figure is drawn on the floor with flour
or rice, turmeric, charcoal powder, and leaves of the castor-oil plant.
If the deity is worshipped at night, it will lead to the acquisition of
knowledge, strength, freedom from disease and impending calamities,
wealth, and prosperity. If p&#363;ja (worship) is celebrated by a
mantrav&#257;di for twelve days with the face turned towards the south,
it will produce the death of an enemy.</p>
<p>Sudarsana yantram, when drawn on a sheet of metal, and enclosed in a
cylinder worn round the neck or on the arm, will relieve those who are
ill or possessed by devils. If it is drawn on butter spread on a
plantain leaf, p&#363;ja performed, and the butter given to a barren
woman, there will be no danger to herself or her future issue.</p>
<p>Suthakadosham yantram. Children under one year of age are supposed
to be affected, if they are seen by a woman on the fourth day of
menstruation with wet clothes and empty stomach after bathing. She may
not even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>see her own baby or husband till she has changed
her clothes, and taken food. To avert the evil, a waist-band, made of
the bark of the arka plant (<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>), is worn.</p>
<p>Sarabha yantram will cure persons suffering from epilepsy or
intermittent fever.</p>
<p>Subramaniya yantram, if regularly worshipped, will expel devils from
those attacked by them, and from houses.</p>
<p>Hanum&#257;n yantram will protect those who are out on dark nights,
and produce bodily strength and wisdom. If drawn on a sheet of gold,
and p&#363;ja is performed to it every Saturday, it will bring
prosperity, and help pregnant women during their confinement.</p>
<p>Pakshi yantram, if drawn on a sheet of lead, and kept in several
places round a house, will keep snakes away.</p>
<p>Vatugabhairava yantram cures disease in those who are under eighteen
years old, and drives out all kinds of evil spirits. If ashes are
smeared on the face, and the mantram is uttered sixteen times, it will
be very effective.</p>
<p>Varati yantram is very useful to any one who wishes to kill an
enemy. He should sit in a retired spot at night, with his face turned
towards the south, and repeat the mantram a thousand times for twenty
days.</p>
<p>Prathingiri yantram is drawn on a sheet of lead, and buried at a
spot over which a person, whose death is desired, will pass. It is then
placed on the floor, on which the sacred fire is kindled. The mantram
should be repeated eight hundred times for seven nights.</p>
<p>Ch&#257;mundi and Raktha Ch&#257;mundi yantrams are used for causing
the death of enemies. The mantram should be written on a sheet of lead,
and p&#363;ja, with the sacrifice of toddy and mutton, performed.</p>

<p>Asv&#257;r&#363;da yantram enables a person wearing it to cover
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>long distances on horseback, and he can make the
most refractory horse amenable by tying it round its neck.<a class=

<p>An inhabitant of Malabar presented Mr Fawcett with a yantram against
the evil eye, which, if whispered over a piece of string, and tied
round any part of the body affected, would work an instantaneous cure.
A Cheruman at Calicut, who was wearing on his loin-string a copper
cylinder containing a brass strip with mantrams, sold it to me for a
rupee with the assurance that it would protect me from devils.</p>
<p>To produce an ulcer, which will cause the death of an enemy in
ninety days, a mantram is written on a piece of cadjan (palm leaf),
enclosed in an egg with a small quantity of earth on which he has
urinated, and buried in an ant-hill. A fowl is killed, and its blood
and some toddy are poured over the egg. To cure fever, the formula is
written with the finger in water contained in a basin, and the
appropriate words are repeated while the water is being drunk.</p>
<p>By some Muhammadans, on festival days, the names of holy persons,
together with their sayings, are written on mango or palmyra leaves in
ink made of charred rice. When the ink is dry, the leaves are washed in
water, which is drunk. This is supposed to cure people of many
obstinate diseases. A European official was informed by a Native
magistrate in the Vizagapatam district that, when he wanted to tear up
some old abk&#257;ri (liquor) licenses, a man implored him not to do
so, as they had brought him life for a year, and were therefore
worshipped. So the medicine was water, in which an old license had been
dipped.</p>
<p>It is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3267src" href="#xd26e3267"
name="xd26e3267src">9</a> by Mr Logan that &ldquo;in 1877, a poor
M&#257;ppilla (Muhammadan) <span class="corr" id="xd26e3270" title=
"Source: women">woman</span> residing in one of the Laccadive islands
was put upon her trial for witchcraft <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>for importing into
the island a betel leaf with a certain cabalistic and magical
inscription on it; but it fortunately turned out for her that she had
merely pounded it up, and rubbed it over her daughter&rsquo;s body to
cure her of fits. Ibn Batuta (the Arab traveller who visited South
India in the fourteenth century) wrote of a Malay&#257;li king who was
converted to Isl&#257;m by the leaf of &lsquo;the tree of
testimony,&rsquo; a tree of which it was related to him that it does
not generally drop its leaves, but at the season of autumn in every
year one of them changes its colour, first to yellow, then to red, and
that upon this is written &lsquo;There is no God but God: Muhammad is
the Prophet of God,&rsquo; and that this leaf alone falls. The falling
of the leaf was an annual event, and the leaf itself was efficacious in
curing diseases. Nowadays the belief among the Muhammadans still
subsists, that the leaves of a certain tree growing on Mount Deli (in
Malabar) possess similar virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Metal bowls, engraved both on the outside and inside with texts from
the Qur&#257;n, are taken or sent by Muhammadans to Mecca, where they
are placed at the head of the tomb of the Prophet, and blessed. They
are highly valued, and used in cases of sickness for the administration
of medicine or nourishment.</p>
<p>It is on record that, at the battle of Seringapatam in 1799, an
officer took from off the right arm of the dead body of T&#299;pu
Sult&#257;n a talisman, which contained sewed up in pieces of fine
flowered silk a charm made of a brittle metallic substance of the
colour of silver, and some manuscripts in magic Arabic and Persian
characters. A notorious M&#257;ppilla dacoit, who was shot by the
police a few years ago, and whom his co-religionists tried to make a
saint, was at the time of his death wearing five copper and silver
charm cylinders round his waist. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr Logan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3283src" href=
"#xd26e3283" name="xd26e3283src">10</a> that &ldquo;when affliction
comes, the animal affected is served with grass, fruit, etc., on which
charms have been whispered, or is bathed in charmed water, or has a
talisman in the shape of a palm leaf inscribed with charms rolled up
and tied round its neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tooth or claw of a tiger, worn on the neck or round the loins,
is considered effective against evil influences. A tiger&rsquo;s
whiskers are held to be a most potent poison when chopped up; so, when
a tiger is killed, the whiskers are immediately singed off.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3288src" href="#xd26e3288" name=
"xd26e3288src">11</a> They are represented in stuffed heads by the
delicate bristles of the porcupine. When a Savara of Ganjam is killed
by a tiger, the Kudang goes through a performance on the following
Sunday to prevent a similar fate overtaking others. Two pigs are killed
outside the village, and every man, woman, and child is made to walk
over the ground whereon the pig&rsquo;s blood is spilled, and the
Kudang gives to each individual some kind of tiger medicine as a
charm.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3291src" href="#xd26e3291" name=
"xd26e3291src">12</a></p>
<p>In Malabar the tusks of a wild boar are, in cases of protracted
labour, pressed over the abdomen of the woman from above downwards.</p>
<p>The hair of the bear is enclosed in a casket or cylinder, and tied
to the girdle round the loins of male children, and in strings round
the neck of female children, as a remedy against fever, and to prevent
involuntary discharge of urine during sleep.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3301src" href="#xd26e3301" name="xd26e3301src">13</a></p>
<p>One of the occupations of the Kuruvikk&#257;rans (bird-catchers and
beggars) is the manufacture and sale of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>spurious jackal
horns, known as narikompu. To catch the jackals they make an enclosure
of a net, inside which a man seats himself armed with a big stick. He
then proceeds to execute a perfect imitation of the jackal&rsquo;s cry,
on hearing which the jackals come running to see what is the matter,
and are beaten down. Sometimes the entire jackal&rsquo;s head is sold,
skin and all. The process of manufacture of the horn is as follows.
After the brain has been removed, the skin is stripped off a limited
area of the skull, and the bone at the place of junction of the
sagittal and lambdoid sutures above the occipital foramen is filed
away, so that only a point, like a bony outgrowth, is left. The skin is
then brought back, and pressed over the little horn which pierces it.
The horn is also said to be made out of the molar tooth of a dog or
jackal, introduced through a small hole in a piece of jackal&rsquo;s
skin, round which a little blood or turmeric paste is smeared to make
it look more natural. In most cases only the horn, with a small piece
of skull and skin, is sold. Sometimes, instead of the skin from the
part where the horn is made, a piece of skin is taken from the snout,
where the long black hairs are. The horn then appears surrounded by
long black bushy hairs. The Kuruvikk&#257;rans explain that, when they
see a jackal with such long hairs on the top of its head, they know
that it possesses a horn. A horn-vendor, whom I interviewed, assured me
that the possessor of a horn is a small jackal, which comes out of its
hiding-place on full-moon nights to drink the dew. According to another
version, the horn is only possessed by the leader of a pack of jackals.
A nomad Dommara, whom I saw at Coimbatore, carried a bag containing a
miscellaneous assortment of rubbish used in his capacity as
medicine-man and snake-charmer, which included a collection of spurious
jackal horns. To prove the genuineness <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>thereof, he showed me
not only the horn, but also the feet with nails complete, as evidence
that the horns were not made from the nails. Being charged with
manufacturing the horns, he swore, by placing his hand on the head of a
child who accompanied him, that he was not deceiving me. The largest of
the horns in his bag, he gravely assured me, was from a jackal which he
dug out of its hole on the last new-moon night. The Sinhalese and
Tamils regard the horn as a talisman, and believe that its fortunate
possessor can command the realisation of every wish. Those who have
jewels to conceal rest in perfect security if, along with them, they
can deposit a narikompu.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3310src" href=
"#xd26e3310" name="xd26e3310src">14</a> The ayah (nurse) of a friend
who possessed such a talisman, remarked: &ldquo;Master going into any
law-court, sure to win the case.&rdquo; Two horns, which I possessed,
were stolen from my study table, to bring luck to some Tamil member of
my establishment.</p>
<p>The nasal bone of a jackal or fox, enclosed in a receptacle, is
believed to ward off many evils. The nose of a hy&aelig;na is also held
in great estimation as a charm. When a hy&aelig;na is killed, the end
of the nose is cut off and dried, and is supposed to be a sovereign
charm in cases of difficult labour, indigestion, and boils, if applied
to the nostrils of the patient.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3315src"
href="#xd26e3315" name="xd26e3315src">15</a></p>
<p>In Malabar, silver finger-rings with a piece of bristle from the
tail of an elephant set in them, are worn as a charm.</p>
<p>In the Vizagapatam district, a most efficacious charm, supposed to
render a man invulnerable to every ill, consists of a small piece of
black wool, given to every one who takes a black sheep for the priest
of a temple on the Bopelli gh&#257;t. Another much valued charm in this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>district is called chemru mausa, which is
described as being a small musk-rat only an inch and a half long, very
scarce, and only found on rocky hills. It is worn in a gold or silver
receptacle on the arm, and is supposed to render a man invulnerable
against sword cuts and musket shots. In like manner, a mixture of
gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil, the red dye which women use, and other
ingredients, put into a small piece of hollow bamboo, and worn on the
arm, are believed to protect a man against being shot with a bow or
musket.</p>
<p>Many of the K&#257;dir infants on the &#256;naimalai hills have tied
round the neck a charm, which takes the form of a dried tortoise foot;
the tooth of a crocodile mimicking a phallus, and supposed to ward off
attacks from a mythical water elephant which lives in the mountain
streams, or wooden imitations of tiger&rsquo;s claws.</p>
<p>The joints taken from the tail of the black scorpion are believed to
ward off illness, if children wear them on their waist-thread.<a class=

<p>Of charms worn by the Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans in Malabar, the
following are recorded by Mr F. Fawcett<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Two cylinders, one of gold, the other of silver. In each were some
chakrams (Travancore silver coins) and a gold leaf, on which a charm
was inscribed. One of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=

is a good thing to wash the face with the hand, on which is a
tamb&#257;k ring. Another wore two rings of the pattern called
tril&#333;ham on the ring-finger of each hand. Each of these was made
during an eclipse. An Akattu Charna N&#257;yar wore an amulet, to keep
off the spirit of a Br&#257;hman who died by drowning.&rdquo;</p>

Bishop Whitehead records<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3373src" href=
"#xd26e3373" name="xd26e3373src">19</a> that a baby three days old had
an anklet made of its mother&rsquo;s hair tied round the right ankle,
to keep off the evil eye. The mother, too, had round her ankle a
similar anklet, which she put on before her confinement. One of the men
was also wearing an anklet of hair, as he had recently been bitten by a
snake.</p>
<p>A metal charm-cylinder is sometimes attached to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>sacred thread, which is worn by
D&#275;v&#257;ngas (a weaving caste), who claim to be D&#275;v&#257;nga
Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>I have seen the child of a Kuruba (Canarese agriculturist) priest
wearing a necklet with a copper ornament engraved with cabalistic
devices, a silver plate bearing a figure of Hanum&#257;n (the monkey
god), as all his other children had died, and a piece of pierced
pottery from the burial-ground, to ward off whooping-cough. The Rev. S.
Nicholson informs me that, if a M&#257;la (Telugu Pariah) child grinds
its teeth in its sleep, a piece of a broken pot is brought from a
graveyard, and, after being smoked with incense, tied round the
child&rsquo;s neck with a piece of string rubbed with turmeric, or with
a piece of gut. In the Tamil country, the bark of a tree on which any
one has hanged himself, a cord with twenty-one knots, and the earth
from a child&rsquo;s grave, are hung round the neck, or tied to the
waist-string as talismans.</p>
<p>A Kota woman at Kotagiri on the N&#299;lgiris, was wearing a glass
necklet, with a charm pendant from it, consisting of the root of some
tree rolled up in a ball of cloth. She put it on when her baby was
quite young, to protect it against devils. The baby had a similar charm
on its neck. By some jungle Chenchus pieces of stick strung on a
thread, or seeds of <i>Givotia rottleriformis</i> are worn, to ward off
various forms of pain.</p>
<p>Small flat plates of copper, called takudu, are frequently worn by
Tamil Paraiyan children. One side is divided into sixteen squares in
which what look like the Telugu numerals nine, ten, eleven and twelve,
are engraved. On the other side a circle is drawn, which is divided
into eight segments, in each of which a Telugu letter is inscribed.
This charm is supposed to protect the wearer from harm coming from any
of the eight cardinal points of the Indian compass. Charms, in the form
of metal cylinders, are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>worn for the same purpose by
adults and children, and procured from some exorcist.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3394src" href="#xd26e3394" name="xd26e3394src">20</a></p>
<p>By some M&#275;daras of the Telugu country, a figure of Hanum&#257;n
(the monkey god) is engraved on a thin plate of gold with cabalistic
letters inscribed on it, and worn on the neck. On eclipse days, a piece
of root of the arka plant (<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>) is worn on the
neck of females, and on the waist or arm of males.</p>
<p>In a note regarding moon-shaped amulets against the evil eye
described by Professor Tylor,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3407src" href=
"#xd26e3407" name="xd26e3407src">21</a> Mr. Walhouse mentions that
crescents, made of thin plates of metal, sometimes gold, are worn by
children on the west coast, suspended upon the breast with the point
upwards. Neck ornaments in the form of a crescent are commonly worn by
Muhammadan children.</p>
<p>Concerning the use of coins as charms, Mr V. Devasahayam writes as
follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3414src" href="#xd26e3414" name=
"xd26e3414src">22</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Seeing a woman with several old coins strung on
the t&#257;li (marriage badge) string round the neck, I offered to buy
them of her for a good price, but got only a torrent of abuse, since
she, in her ignorance and superstition, supposed that Lutchmi, the
goddess of fortune, would forsake her if she parted with the coins. In
Tranquebar there lives a head mason, who always carries in his
betel-nut bag a copper coin bearing the inscription of Kon&#275;ri
R&#257;yan, one of the later P&#257;ndyans or early N&#257;yakars. The
man would on no account part with this coin, for he believes that his
success in business has improved since he came into possession of it,
and that it will continue as long as he carries it with him. He says
that he shall bequeath it to his family at his death, to hold in
veneration almost amounting to worship. For <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>dog
bite, some Natives tie an old copper coin with a bandage over the
wound, and wear it till it has healed. Others rub the coin against a
copper vessel, using a few drops of the juice of the datura plant in
order to form a paste, and apply the paste to the wound. Whooping-cough
is believed to be caused by the displeasure of Bhairava, the dog-god,
and the whooping is regarded as a sort of barking, under possession by
the god. To appease his anger, an old coin is hammered into a flat
round disc, a rude figure of a dog engraved on it, and suspended as a
charm to the sick child&rsquo;s waist. In the treatment of skin
disease, dyspepsia, and leprosy, old copper coins are ground to dust,
heated till the dust is like ashes, and administered medicinally. Soon
after a Sonaga woman is delivered of a child, she is made to swallow a
small old copper coin together with some water. Natives believe that,
during delivery, the whole system is so irritated that strong
counter-irritants must be administered to prevent tetanus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercury cups, said to be made of an amalgam of mercury and tin, are
stated to possess the property of allowing mercury, when poured in, to
ooze through them, and pass out. Milk preserved in such a cup for a few
hours is said to turn into hard curd. Milk kept over night in one of
these cups, or an amulet made from the cup materials, are believed to
exercise a most potent influence over the male fertilising element.
Such an amulet, applied to the neck of a chorister, is said to have
increased his vocal powers three or four times. Piles, and other bodily
ailments, are believed to be cured by wearing rings, in the composition
of which mercury is one of the ingredients.</p>
<p>In a case which was tried before a magistrate in Travancore, the
accused, in order to win his case, had concealed in his under-cloth
some yantrams, which had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>been prepared for him by a
sorcerer. The plaintiff, having got scent of this, gave information,
and the charms were handed over to the magistrate. It is recorded in
the Vigada Th&#363;than that, when a woman who gets tired of her
husband sues him for maintenance, she wears charm bundles (manthira
kattu), so that his evidence may be confused and incoherent. Such
charms are said to be concealed in the hair of the head or in the
headdress, and generally to consist of a lime fruit, which has been
charmed by magical spells in a graveyard, after the sorcerer has
performed certain ceremonies to guard him against devils catching him
during the incantations. It is said that, in former times, if the
chastity of a Tamil Paraiyan bride was suspected, she had to establish
her virtue by picking some cakes out of boiling oil, and then husking
some rice with her bare hand. Her hair, nails, and clothes were
examined, to see that she had no charm concealed about her.<a class=

<p>A friend once dismissed a servant for cheating and lying. A short
time afterwards, he found nailed to a teapoy a paper scroll containing
a jasmine flower tied up with coloured threads. On the scroll were
inscribed in Tamil the mystic syllable, &ldquo;Om,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;N&#257;ma S&#299;va R. U. Masth&#257;n S&#257;hibu avergal
p&#257;dame thunai&rdquo; (I seek for help at the feet of Masth&#257;n
s&#257;hib). Masth&#257;n is a Muhammad saint. The servant of a
European police officer, who had been caught out in all sorts of
malpractices, tried to win back the good-will of his master by means of
a charm, for which he paid fifteen rupees, placed under his
master&rsquo;s pillow.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Marco Polo<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3441src"
href="#xd26e3441" name="xd26e3441src">24</a> that South Indian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>pearl divers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3446src"
href="#xd26e3446" name="xd26e3446src">25</a> call in the services of an
Abraiman (Br&#257;hman?) to charm the sharks. &ldquo;And their charm
holds good for that day only; for at night they dissolve the charm, so
that the fishes can work mischief at their will.&rdquo; The prospects
of a pearl fishery, when success seems certain, may be abruptly ruined
by accidents from sharks, of which the divers have a superstitious, but
not altogether unreasonable, dread. Before the fishery of 1889, at
which I was present, the divers of Kilakarai on the Madura coast, as a
preliminary to starting for the scene thereof, performed a ceremony, at
which prayers were offered for protection against the attacks of
sharks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The only precaution,&rdquo; Tennent
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3452src" href="#xd26e3452" name=
"xd26e3452src">26</a> &ldquo;to which the Ceylon diver devotedly
resorts is the mystic ceremony of the shark-charmer, whose power is
believed to be hereditary. Nor is it supposed that the value of his
incantations is at all dependent upon the religious faith professed by
the operator, for the present head of the family happens to be a Roman
Catholic. At the time of our visit, this mysterious functionary was
ill, and unable to attend; but he sent an accredited substitute, who
assured me that, although he was himself ignorant of the grand and
mystic secret, the fact of his presence, as a representative of the
higher authority, would be recognised and respected by the
sharks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Tuticorin fishery in 1890, a scare was produced by a diver
being bitten by a shark, but subsided as soon as a &ldquo;wise
woman&rdquo; was employed. Her powers do not, however, seem to have
been great, for more cases of shark-bite occurred, and the fishery had
to be abandoned at a time when favourable breezes, clear water, plenty
of boats, and oysters selling at a good price, indicated a successful
financial result. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199"

<p class="first">&ldquo;The best known case,&rdquo; Mr Frazer
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3467src" href="#xd26e3467" name=
"xd26e3467src">1</a> &ldquo;of human sacrifices systematically offered
to ensure good crops, is supplied by the Khonds or Kandhs, a Dravidian
race in Bengal and Madras. Our knowledge of them is derived from the
accounts written by British officers, who, forty or fifty years ago,
were engaged in putting them down. The sacrifices were offered to the
earth goddess, Tari Pennu or Bera Pennu, and were believed to ensure
good crops, and immunity from all diseases and accidents. In
particular, they were considered necessary in the cultivation of
turmeric, the Khonds arguing that the turmeric could not have a deep
red colour without the shedding of blood. The victim, a Meriah, was
acceptable to the goddess only if he had been purchased, or had been
born a victim, that is, the son of a victim father, or had been devoted
as a child by his father or guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p>In 1837, Mr Russell, in a report on the districts entrusted to his
control, wrote as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3478src" href=
"#xd26e3478" name="xd26e3478src">2</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The ceremonies attending the barbarous rite
(Kondh human sacrifice) vary in different parts of the country. In the
M&#257;liahs of Goomsur, the sacrifice is offered annually to Thadha
Pennoo, under the effigy of a bird intended to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>represent a peacock, with the view of
propitiating the deity to grant favourable seasons and crops. The
ceremony is performed at the expense of, and in rotation, by certain
mootahs (districts) composing a community, and connected together from
local circumstances. Besides these periodical sacrifices, others are
made by single mootahs, and even by individuals, to avert any
threatening calamity from sickness, murrain, or other causes. Grown men
are the most esteemed (as victims), because the most costly. Children
are purchased, and reared for years with the family of the person who
ultimately devotes them to a cruel death, when circumstances are
supposed to demand a sacrifice at his hands. They seem to be treated
with kindness, and, if young, are kept under no constraint; but, when
old enough to be sensible of the fate that awaits them, they are placed
in fetters, and guarded. Most of those who were rescued had been sold
by their parents or nearest relations, a practice which, from all we
could learn, is very common. Persons of riper age are kidnapped by
wretches who trade in human flesh. The victim must always be purchased.
Criminals, or prisoners captured in war, are not considered fitting
subjects. The price is paid indifferently in brass utensils, cattle, or
coin. The zanee (or priest), who may be of any caste, officiates at the
sacrifice, but he performs the poojah (offering of flowers, incense,
etc.) to the idol through the medium of the Toomba, who must be a Khond
child under seven years of age. This child is fed and clothed at the
public expense, eats with no other person, and is subjected to no act
deemed impure. For a month prior to the sacrifice, there is much
feasting and intoxication, and dancing round the Meriah, who is adorned
with garlands, etc., and, on the day before the performance of the
barbarous rite, is stupefied with toddy, and made to sit, or, if
necessary, is bound at the bottom of a post bearing the effigy above
described. The assembled multitude then dance around to music, and,
addressing the earth, say &lsquo;Oh! God, we offer the sacrifice to
you. Give us good crops, seasons, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>and health.&rsquo; After
which they address the victim. &lsquo;We bought you with a price, and
did not seize you. Now we sacrifice you according to custom, and no sin
rests with us.&rsquo; On the following day, the victim being again
intoxicated, and anointed with oil, each individual present touches the
anointed part, and wipes the oil on his own head. All then proceed in
procession around the village and its boundaries, preceded by music,
bearing the victim and a pole, to the top of which is attached a tuft
of peacock&rsquo;s feathers. On returning to the post, which is always
placed near the village deity called Zakaree Pennoo, and represented by
three stones, near which the brass effigy in the shape of the peacock
is buried, they kill a pig in sacrifice, and, having allowed the blood
to flow into a pit prepared for the purpose, the victim who, if it has
been found possible, has been previously made senseless from
intoxication, is seized and thrown in, and his face pressed down until
he is suffocated in the bloody mire amid the noise of instruments. The
Zanee then cuts a piece of the flesh from the body, and buries it with
ceremony near the effigy and village idol, as an offering to the earth.
All the rest afterwards go through the same form, and carry the bloody
prize to their villages, where the same rites are performed, part being
interred near the village idol, and little bits on the boundaries. The
head and face remain untouched, and the bones, when bare, are buried
with them in the pit. After this horrid ceremony has been completed, a
buffalo calf is brought in front of the post, and, his forefeet having
been cut off, is left there till the following day. Women, dressed in
male attire, and armed as men, then drink, dance, and sing round the
spot, the calf is killed and eaten, and the Zanee is dismissed with a
present of rice, and a hog or calf.&rdquo;</p>

"pb202">202</a>]</span>Codooloo. The former class is that which is in
the habit of offering human sacrifices to the god called Jenkery, with
a view to secure good crops. This ceremony is generally performed on
the Sunday preceding or following the Pongal feast. The victim is
seldom carried by force, but procured by purchase, and there is a fixed
price for each person, which consists of forty articles such as a
bullock, a male buffalo, a cow, a goat, a piece of cloth, a silk cloth,
a brass pot, a large plate, a bunch of plantains, etc. The man who is
destined for the sacrifice is immediately carried before the god, and a
small quantity of rice coloured with saffron (turmeric) is put upon his
head. The influence of this is said to prevent his attempting to
escape, even though set at liberty. It would appear, however, that,
from the moment of his seizure till he is sacrificed, he is kept in a
continued state of stupefaction or intoxication. He is allowed to
wander about the village, to eat and drink anything he may take a fancy
to, and even to have connection with any of the women whom he may meet.
On the morning set apart for the sacrifice, he is carried before the
idol in a state of intoxication. One of the villagers officiates as
priest, who cuts a small hole in the stomach of the victim, and with
the blood that flows from the wound the idol is besmeared. Then the
crowds from the neighbouring villages rush forward, and he is literally
cut into pieces. Each person who is so fortunate as to procure it
carries away a morsel of the flesh, and presents it to the idol of his
own village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concerning a method of Kondh sacrifice, which is illustrated by the
wooden post preserved in the Madras Museum, Colonel Campbell
records<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3511src" href="#xd26e3511" name=
"xd26e3511src">3</a> that &ldquo;one of the most common ways of
offering the sacrifice in Chinna Kimedi is to the effigy of an elephant
(hatti mundo or elephant&rsquo;s head) rudely carved in wood, fixed on
the top <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>of a stout post, on which it is made to revolve.
After the performance of the usual ceremonies, the intended victim is
fastened to the proboscis of the elephant, and, amidst the shouts and
yells of the excited multitude of Khonds, is rapidly whirled round,
when, at a given signal by the officiating Zanee or priest, the crowd
rush in, seize the Meriah, and with their knives cut the flesh off the
shrieking wretch so long as life remains. He is then cut down, the
skeleton burnt, and the horrid orgies are over. In several villages I
counted as many as fourteen effigies of elephants, which had been used
in former sacrifices. These I caused to be overthrown by the baggage
elephants attached to my camp in the presence of the assembled Khonds,
to show them that these venerated objects had no power against the
living animal, and to remove all vestiges of their bloody
superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Risley<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3518src" href=
"#xd26e3518" name="xd26e3518src">4</a> that, while the crowd hacked the
body of the victim, they chanted a ghastly hymn, an extract from which
illustrates very clearly the theory of sympathetic magic underlying the
ritual:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;As the tears stream from thine eyes,</p>
<p class="line">So may the rain pour down in August;</p>
<p class="line">As the mucus trickles from thy nostrils,</p>
<p class="line">So may it drizzle at intervals;</p>
<p class="line">As thy blood gushes forth,</p>
<p class="line">So may the vegetation sprout;</p>
<p class="line">As thy gore falls in drops,</p>
<p class="line">So may the grains of rice form.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In another report, Colonel Campbell describes how the
miserable victim is dragged along the fields, surrounded by a crowd of
half intoxicated Kondhs who, shouting and screaming, rush upon him, and
with their knives cut the flesh piecemeal from the bones, avoiding the
head and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>bowels, till the living skeleton, dying from
loss of blood, is relieved from torture, when its remains are burnt,
and the ashes mixed with the new grain to preserve it from insects. Yet
again, he describes a sacrifice which was peculiar to the Kondhs of
Jeypore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;always succeeded
by the sacrifice of three human beings, two to the sun in the east and
west of the village, and one in the centre, with the usual barbarities
of the Meriah. A stout wooden post about six feet long is firmly fixed
in the ground, at the foot of it a narrow grave is dug, and to the top
of the post the victim is firmly fastened by the long hair of his head.
Four assistants hold his outstretched arms and legs, the body being
suspended horizontally over the grave, with the face toward the earth.
The officiating Junna or priest, standing on the right side, repeats
the following invocation, at intervals hacking with his sacrificing
knife the back part of the shrieking victim&rsquo;s neck. &lsquo;Oh!
mighty Manicksoro, this is your festal day. To the Khonds the offering
is Meriah, to the kings Junna. On account of this sacrifice, you have
given to kings kingdoms, guns, and swords. The sacrifice we now offer
you must eat, and we pray that our battle-axes may be converted into
swords, our bows and arrows into gunpowder and balls; and, if we have
any quarrels with other tribes, give us the victory. Preserve us from
the tyranny of kings and their officers.&rsquo; Then, addressing the
victim, &lsquo;That we may enjoy prosperity, we offer you as a
sacrifice to our god Manicksoro, who will immediately eat you, so be
not grieved at our slaying you. Your parents were aware, when we
purchased you from them for sixty rupees, that we did so with intent to
sacrifice you. There is, therefore, no sin on our heads, but on your
parents. After you are dead, we shall perform your obsequies.&rsquo;
The victim is then decapitated, the body thrown into the grave, and the
head left suspended from the post till devoured by wild beasts. The
knife <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>remains fastened to the post till the three
sacrifices have been performed, when it is removed with much
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kondhs of Bara Mootah promised to relinquish the Meriah rite on
condition, <i>inter alia</i>, that they should be at liberty to
sacrifice buffaloes, monkeys, goats, etc., to their deities, with all
the solemnities observed on occasions of human sacrifice; and that they
should further be at liberty, upon all occasions, to denounce to their
gods the Government, and some of its servants in particular, as the
cause of their having relinquished the great rite. The last recorded
Meriah sacrifice in the Ganjam M&#257;liahs occurred in 1852, and there
are still Kondhs alive, who were present at it. The veteran members of
a party of Kondhs, who were brought to Madras for the purpose of
performing their dances before the Prince and Princess of Wales in
1906, became widely excited when they came across the relic of their
barbarous custom at the museum. Twenty-five descendants of persons who
were rescued by Government officers, returned themselves as Meriah at
the census, 1901.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr W. Francis that<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3556src" href="#xd26e3556" name="xd26e3556src">5</a> &ldquo;goats
and buffaloes nowadays take the place of human meriah victims, but the
belief in the superior efficacy of the latter dies hard, and every now
and again revives. When the Rampa rebellion of 1879&ndash;80 spread in
this district, several cases of human sacrifice occurred in the
disturbed tracts. In 1880, two persons were convicted of attempting a
meriah sacrifice near Ambad&#257;la in Bissamkatak. In 1883, a man (a
beggar and a stranger) was found at daybreak murdered in one of the
temples in Jeypore in circumstances which pointed to his having been
slain as a meriah; and, as late as 1886, a formal enquiry <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>showed that there were ample grounds for the
suspicion that the kidnapping of victims still went on in
Bastar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so recently as 1902, a European magistrate in Ganjam received a
petition, asking for permission to perform a human sacrifice, which was
intended to give a rich colour to the turmeric crop.</p>
<p>The flowers with which the sheep and goats which take the place of
human beings are decorated are still known as meriah pushpa in
Jeypore.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3565src" href="#xd26e3565" name=
"xd26e3565src">6</a></p>
<p>In an account<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3570src" href="#xd26e3570"
name="xd26e3570src">7</a> of a substituted sacrifice, which was carried
out by the Kondhs in the Ganjam M&#257;liahs in 1894, it is stated
that, &ldquo;the Janni gave the buffalo a tap on the head with a small
axe. An indescribable scene followed. The Khonds in a body fell on the
animal, and, in an amazingly short time, literally tore the living
victim to shreds with their knives, leaving nothing but the head,
bones, and stomach. Death must mercifully have been almost
instantaneous. Every particle of flesh and skin had been stripped off
during the few minutes they fought and struggled over the buffalo,
eagerly grasping for every atom of flesh. As soon as a man had secured
a piece thereof, he rushed away with the gory mass, as fast as he
could, to his fields, to bury it therein according to ancient custom,
before the sun had set. As some of them had to do good distances to
effect this, it was imperative that they should run very fast. A
curious scene now took place. As the men ran, all the women flung after
them clods of earth, some of them taking very good effect. The sacred
grove was cleared of people, save a few that guarded the remnants left
of the buffalo, which were taken, and burnt with ceremony at the foot
of the stake.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207"
name="pb207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>The buffalo sacrifice is not unaccompanied by risk, as the animal,
before dying, sometimes kills one or more of its tormentors. This was
the case near Balliguda in 1899, when a buffalo killed the sacrificer.
In the previous year, the desire of a village to intercept the bearer
of the flesh from a neighbouring village led to a fight, in which two
men were killed.</p>
<p>Like the Kondhs, the Koyis of the God&#257;vari district believe in
the efficacy of a sacrifice, to ensure good crops. In this connection,
the Rev. J. Cain writes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3580src" href=
"#xd26e3580" name="xd26e3580src">8</a> that &ldquo;the Koyi goddess
M&#257;mili or L&#275;le must be propitiated early in the year, or else
the crops will undoubtedly fail; and she is said to be very partial to
human victims. There is strong reason to think that two men were
murdered this year (1876) near a village not far from Dummagudem as
offerings to this d&#275;vata, and there is no reason to doubt that
every year strangers are quietly put out of the way in the Bastar
country, to ensure the favour of the bloodthirsty goddess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Cain writes further<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3585src" href=
"#xd26e3585" name="xd26e3585src">9</a> that a langur monkey is now
substituted for the human victim under the name of erukomma potu or
male with small breasts, in the hope of persuading the goddess that she
is receiving a human sacrifice.</p>
<p>On the site of the old fort at R&#257;magiri in the Vizagapatam
district, a victim was formerly sacrificed every third year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The poor wretch was forced into a hole in the
ground, three feet deep and eighteen inches square, at the bottom of
which the goddess was supposed to dwell, his throat was cut, and the
blood allowed to flow into the hole, and afterwards his head was struck
off and placed on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208"
name="pb208">208</a>]</span>his lap, and the mutilated body covered
with earth and a mound of stones until the time for the next sacrifice
came round, when the bones were taken out and thrown away. At
Malkanagiri, periodical sacrifices occurred at the four gates of the
fort, and the R&#257;ni had a victim slain as a thank-offering for her
recovery from an illness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3597src"
href="#xd26e3597" name="xd26e3597src">10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nomad Koravas are said to have formerly performed human
sacrifices, one effect of which was to increase the fertility of the
soil. The following account of such a sacrifice was given to Mr C.
Hayavadana Rao by an old inhabitant of the village of As&#363;r near
Walajabad in the Chingleput district. A big gang of Koravas settled at
the meeting point of three villages of As&#363;r, M&#275;lputt&#363;r,
and Aval&#363;r, on an elevated spot commanding the surrounding
country. They had with them their pack-bullocks, each headman of the
gang owning about two hundred head. The cow-dung which accumulated
daily attracted a good many of the villagers, on one of whom the
headman fixed as their intended victim. They made themselves intimate
with him, plied him with drink and tobacco, and gave him the monopoly
of the cow-dung. Thus a week or ten days passed away, and the Koravas
then fixed a day for the sacrifice. They invited the victim to visit
them at dusk, and witness a great festival in honour of their caste
goddess. At the appointed hour, the man went to the settlement, and was
induced to drink freely. Meanwhile, a pit, large enough for a man to
stand upright in, had been prepared. At about midnight, the victim was
seized, and forced to stand in the pit, which was filled in up to his
neck. This done, the women and children of the gang made off with their
belongings. As soon as the last of them had quitted the settlement, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>headmen brought a large quantity of fresh
cow-dung, and placed a ball of it on the head of the victim. The ball
served as a support for an earthen lamp, which was lighted. The man was
by this time nearly dead, and the cattle were made to pass over his
head. The headmen then made off, and, by daybreak, the whole gang had
disappeared. The sacrificed man was found by the villagers, who have,
since that time, scrupulously avoided the Koravas. The victim is said
to have turned into a Munisvara, and for a long time troubled those who
happened to go near the spot at noon or midnight. The Koravas are said
to have performed the sacrifice, so as to insure their cattle against
death from disease. The ground, on which they encamped, and on which
they offered the human sacrifice, is stated to have been barren prior
thereto, and, as the result thereof, to have become very fertile.</p>
<p>A similar form of human sacrifice was practised in former days by
the nomad Lamb&#257;dis, concerning which the Abb&eacute; Dubois writes
as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3606src" href="#xd26e3606" name=
"xd26e3606src">11</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;When they wish to perform this horrible act, it
is said, they secretly carry off the first person they meet. Having
conducted the victim to some lonely spot, they dig a hole, in which
they bury him up to the neck. While he is still alive, they make a sort
of lamp of dough made of flour, which they place on his head. This they
fill with oil, and light four wicks in it. Having done this, the men
and women join hands, and, forming a circle, dance round their victim,
singing and making a great noise, till he expires.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is recorded by the Rev. J. Cain<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3615src" href="#xd26e3615" name="xd26e3615src">12</a> that the
Lamb&#257;dis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>confessed that, in former days, it was the
custom among them, before starting out on a journey, to procure a
little child, and bury it in the ground up to the shoulders, and then
drive their loaded bullocks over the unfortunate victim. In proportion
to their thoroughly trampling the child to death, so their belief in a
successful journey increased. I am informed by the Rev. G. N. Thomssen
that, at the present day, the Lamb&#257;dis sacrifice a goat or
chicken, in case of removal from one part of the jungle to another,
when sickness has come. They hope to escape death by leaving one
camping ground for another. Half-way between the old and new grounds,
the animal selected is buried alive, the head being allowed to be above
ground. Then all the cattle are driven over the buried creature, and
the whole camp walk over the buried victim.</p>
<p>In the course of an interview with Colonel Marshall on the subject
of infanticide<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3623src" href="#xd26e3623"
name="xd26e3623src">13</a> among the Todas of the N&#299;lgiri hills,
an aged man of the tribe remarked that<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3629src" href="#xd26e3629" name="xd26e3629src">14</a>
&ldquo;those tell lies who say that we laid the child down before the
opening of the buffalo-pen, so that it might be run over and killed by
the animals. We never did such things, and it is all nonsense that we
drowned it in buffaloes&rsquo; milk. Boys were never killed&mdash;only
girls; not those who were sickly and deformed&mdash;that would be a
sin; but, when we had one girl, or in some families two girls, those
that followed were killed. An old woman used to take the child
immediately after it was born, and close its nostrils, ears, and mouth
with a cloth. It would shortly droop its head and go to sleep. We then
buried it in the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s remark about the cattle-pen refers to the
Malagasy custom of placing a new-born child at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>entrance to a cattle-pen, and then driving the
cattle over it, to see whether they would trample on it or
not.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3636src" href="#xd26e3636" name=
"xd26e3636src">15</a></p>
<p>It is recorded by Bishop Whitehead,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3641src" href="#xd26e3641" name="xd26e3641src">16</a> in a note
on offerings and sacrifices in the Telugu country, that
&ldquo;sometimes, when there is a cattle disease, a pig is buried up to
its neck at the boundary of the village, a heap of boiled rice is
deposited near the spot, and then all the cattle of the village are
driven over the head of the unhappy pig&#8202;&hellip;. When I was on
tour in the Kurnool district, an old man described to me the account he
had received from his &lsquo;forefathers&rsquo; of the ceremonies
observed when founding a new village. An auspicious site is selected on
an auspicious day, and then, in the centre of the site, is dug a large
hole, in which are placed different kinds of grains, small pieces of
the five metals, and a large stone called boddu-ray&eacute;e
(navel-stone), standing about three and a half feet above the ground,
very like the ordinary boundary stones seen in the fields. Then, at the
entrance of the village, in the centre of the main street, where most
of the cattle pass in and out on their way to and from the fields, they
dig another hole, and bury a pig alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is suggested by Bishop Whitehead that the custom of thus burying
a pig may be connected with the worship of an agricultural goddess, or
a survival of a former custom of infanticide or human sacrifice, such
as prevailed among the Lamb&#257;dis.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that certain rites performed by the P&#257;nan
and Malayan exorcists of Malabar are survivals, or imitations of human
sacrifice. Thus, in the Ucchav&#275;li ceremony of the P&#257;nans for
driving out devils, there is a mock burial of the principal performer,
who is placed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>a pit. This is covered with planks, on the
top of which a sacrifice (h&#333;mam) is performed with a fire kindled
with jak (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) branches.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3656src" href="#xd26e3656" name="xd26e3656src">17</a></p>
<p>The disguise of Ucchav&#275;li is also assumed by the Malayans for
the propitiation of the demon, when a human sacrifice is considered
necessary. The Malayan who is to take the part puts on a cap made of
strips of cocoanut leaf, and strips of the same leaves tied to a bent
bamboo stick round his waist. His face and chest are daubed with yellow
paint, and designs are drawn thereon in red or black. Strings are tied
tightly round the left arm near the elbow and wrist, and the swollen
area is pierced with a knife. The blood spouts out, and the performer
waves the arm, so that his face is covered with blood. In the ceremony
for propitiating the demon Nenaveli (bloody sacrifice), the Malayan
smears the upper part of the body and face with a paste made of
rice-flour reddened with turmeric powder and chunam (lime), to indicate
a sacrifice. Before the paste dries, parched paddy (unhusked rice)
grains, representing smallpox pustules, are sprinkled over it. Strips
of young cocoanut leaves, strung together so as to form a petticoat,
are tied round the waist, a ball of sacred ashes (vibh&#363;thi) is
fixed on the tip of the nose, and two strips of palm leaf are placed in
the mouth to represent fangs. If it is thought that a human sacrifice
is necessary to propitiate the devil, the man representing Nenaveli
puts round his neck a kind of framework made of plantain leaf sheaths;
and, after he has danced with it on, it is removed, and placed on the
ground in front of him. A number of lighted wicks are stuck in the
middle of the framework, which is sprinkled with the blood of a fowl,
and then beaten and crushed. Sometimes this is not regarded as
sufficient, and the performer is made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>to lie in a pit,
which is covered over by a plank, and a fire kindled. A Malayan, who
acted the part of Nenaveli before me, danced and gesticulated wildly,
while a small boy, concealed behind him, sang songs in praises of the
demon, to the accompaniment of a drum. At the end of the performance,
he feigned extreme exhaustion, and laid on the ground in a state of
apparent collapse, while he was drenched with water brought in pots
from a neighbouring well.</p>
<p>A very similar rite has been recorded by Mr Lewis Rice as being
carried out by the Coorgs, when a particular curse, which can only be
removed by an extraordinary sacrifice, rests on a house, stable, or
field. Concerning this sacrifice, Mr Rice writes as follows<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3665src" href="#xd26e3665" name=
"xd26e3665src">18</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Kaniya (religious mendicant)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3671src" href="#xd26e3671" name=
"xd26e3671src">19</a> sends for some of his fraternity, the Panikas or
Bannus, and they set to work. A pit is dug in the middle room of the
house or in the yard, or in the stable, or in the field, as the
occasion may require. Into this one of the magicians descends. He sits
down in Hindu fashion, muttering mantras. Pieces of wood are laid
across the pit, and covered with earth a foot or two deep. Upon this
platform a fire of jackwood is kindled, into which butter, sugar,
different kinds of grain, etc., are thrown. This sacrifice continues
all night, the Panika sacrificer above, and his immured colleague
below, repeating their incantations all the while. In the morning the
pit is opened, and the man returns to the light of day. These
sacrifices are called maranada bali, or death atonements. Instead of a
human being, a cock is sometimes shut up in the pit, and killed
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence is produced by Mr Rice<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3677src"
href="#xd26e3677" name="xd26e3677src">20</a> that, in former days,
human sacrifices were offered in Coorg, to secure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>the
favour of the Gr&#257;ma D&#275;vatas (village goddesses) Mariamma,
Durga, and Bhadra Kali.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In Kirinadu and Koniucheri Gr&#257;mas,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;once every three years, in December and June, a human
sacrifice used to be brought to Bhadra Kali, and, during the offering
by the Panikas, the people exclaimed &lsquo;Al Amma&rsquo; (a man, Oh
mother), but once a devotee shouted &lsquo;Al all Amma, Adu&rsquo; (not
a man, oh mother, a goat), and since that time a he-goat without
blemish has been sacrificed. Similarly, in Bellur, once a year, by
turns from each house, a man was sacrificed by cutting off his head at
the temple; but, when the turn came to a certain home, the devoted
victim made his escape to the jungle. The villagers, after an
unsuccessful search, returned to the temple, and said to the
p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) &lsquo;Kalak Adu,&rsquo; which has a double
meaning, viz., Kalake next year, adu he will give, or adu a goat, and
thenceforth only scapegoats were offered.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human sacrifice is considered efficacious in appeasing the earth
spirit, and in warding off devils during the construction of a new
railway or big bridge. To the influence of such evil spirits the death
of several workmen by accident in a cutting on the railway, which was
under construction at Cannanore in Malabar, was attributed. A legend is
current at Anantapur that, on one occasion, the embankment of the big
tank breached. Ganga, the goddess of water, entered the body of a
woman, and explained through her that, if some one was thrown into the
breach, she would cause no further damage. Accordingly, one Musalamma
was thrown in, and buried within it. The spot is marked by several
margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) trees, and sheep, fowls, etc., are
still occasionally offered to the girl who was thus sacrificed. When a
tank bund (embankment) was under construction <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>in
Mysore, there was a panic among the workmen, owing to a rumour that
three virgins were going to be sacrificed. When a mantapam or shrine
was consecrated, a human sacrifice was formerly considered necessary,
but a cocoanut is now sometimes used as a substitute. At Kalasap&#257;d
in the Cuddapah district, a missionary told Bishop Whitehead that, when
a new ward was opened at the mission dispensary in 1906, none would
enter it, because the people believed that the first to enter would be
offered as a sacrifice. Their fears were allayed by a religious
service. During the building of a tower at the Madras Museum, just
before the big granite blocks were placed in position, the coolies
contented themselves with the sacrifice of a goat. On the completion of
a new building, some castes on the west coast sacrifice a fowl or
sheep, to drive away the devils, which are supposed to haunt it.</p>
<p>In a field outside a village in South Canara, Mr Walhouse noticed a
large square marked in lines with whitewash on the ground, with magic
symbols in the corners, and the outline of a human figure rudely drawn
in the middle. Flowers and boiled rice had been laid on leaves round
the figure. He was informed that a house was to be built on the site
marked out, and the figure was intended to represent the earth spirit
supposed to be dwelling in the ground (or a human sacrifice?). Without
this ceremony being performed before the earth was dug up, it was
believed that there would be no luck about the house.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3695src" href="#xd26e3695" name="xd26e3695src">21</a></p>
<p>Belief in the efficacy of human sacrifice as a means of discovering
hidden treasure is widespread. It is recorded by Mr Walhouse<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3700src" href="#xd26e3700" name=
"xd26e3700src">22</a> that &ldquo;one of the native notions respecting
p&shy;&#257;ndu kuli, or kistvaens, is that men of old constructed them
for the purpose of hiding treasure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>Hence it is that
antiquarians find so many have been ransacked. It is also believed that
spells were placed over them as a guard, the strongest being to bury a
man alive in the cairn, and bid his ghost protect the deposit against
any but the proprietor. The ghost would conceal the treasure from all
strangers, or only be compelled to disclose it by a human sacrifice
being offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many beliefs exist with regard to the purpose for which the large
prehistoric burial jars, such as are found in various parts of Southern
India, were manufactured. In Travancore, some believe that they were
made to contain the remains of virgins sacrificed by the R&#257;jas on
the boundaries of their estates, to protect them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3710src" href="#xd26e3710" name="xd26e3710src">23</a> According
to another idea, the jars were made for the purpose of burying alive in
them old women who refused to die.</p>
<p>In a note on the Velamas of the God&#257;vari district, Mr F. R.
Hemingway writes that they admit that they always arrange for a
M&#257;la (Telugu Pariah) couple to marry, before they have a marriage
in their own houses, and that they provide the necessary funds for the
M&#257;la marriage. They explain the custom by a story to the effect
that a M&#257;la once allowed a Velama to sacrifice him in order to
obtain a hidden treasure, and they say that this custom is observed out
of gratitude for the discovery of the treasure which resulted. The Rev.
J. Cain gives a similar custom among the Velamas of Bhadr&#257;chalam
in the God&#257;vari district, only in this case it is a Palli
(fisherman) who has to be married. Some years ago, a Native of the west
coast, believing that treasure was hidden on his property, took council
with an astrologer, who recommended the performance of a human
sacrifice, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>which happily was averted. On one occasion, a
little Br&#257;hman girl is said to have been decoyed when on her way
to school, and murdered in the god&rsquo;s room at a temple in Vellore,
in which treasure was supposed to be concealed.</p>
<p>In 1901, a Native of the Bellary district was tried for the murder
of his child, in the belief that hidden treasure would thereby be
revealed to him. The man, whose story I heard from himself in the
lock-up, had apparently implicit faith that the god would bring the
child to life again. The case, as recorded in the judgment of the
Sessions Judge, was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The prisoner has made two long statements to
the Magistrate, in each of which he explains why he killed the child.
From these statements it appears that he had been worshipping at the
temple of Kona Irappa for six or seven years, and that, on one or more
occasions, the god appeared to him, and said: &lsquo;I am much pleased
with your worship. There is wealth under me. To whom else should it be
given but you?&rsquo; The god asked the prisoner to sacrifice sheep and
buffaloes, and also said: &lsquo;Give your son&rsquo;s head. You know
that a head should be given to the god who confers a boon. I shall
raise up your son, and give you the wealth which is under me.&rsquo; At
that time, the prisoner had only one son&mdash;the deceased boy was not
then born. The prisoner said to the god: &lsquo;I have only one son.
How can I give him?&rsquo; The god replied: &lsquo;A son will be born.
Do not fear me. I shall revive the son, and give you wealth.&rsquo;
Within one year, the deceased boy was born. This increased the
prisoner&rsquo;s faith in the god, and it is apparent from his own
statement that he has for some time past been contemplating human
sacrifice. He was advised not to sacrifice the son, and for a time was
satisfied with sacrificing a buffalo and goats, but, as a result, did
not succeed in getting the wealth that he was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>anxious to secure. The prisoner says he dug up
some portion of the temple, but the temple people did not let him dig
further. The boy was killed on a Sunday, because the prisoner says that
the god informed him that the human sacrifice should be on the
child&rsquo;s birthday, which was a Sunday. The prisoner mentions in
his statement how he took the child to the temple on the Sunday
morning, and cut him with a sword. Having done so, he proceeded to
worship, saying: &lsquo;I offered a head to the bestower of boons. Give
boons, resuscitate my son, and show me wealth.&rsquo; While the
prisoner was worshipping the god, and waiting for the god to revive his
son, the Reddi (headman) and the police came to the temple, and
interrupted the worship. The prisoner believes that thereby the god was
prevented from reviving the son&#8202;&hellip;. The facts seem to be
clear. The man&rsquo;s mind is sound in every respect but as regards
this religious delusion. On that point, it is unsound.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bad feature of the case, which was reckoned against the prisoner,
was that he deferred the sacrifice until a second son was born, so
that, in any case, he was not left without male issue. It was laid down
by Manu that a man is perfect when he consists of three&mdash;himself,
his wife, and his son. In the Rig V&#275;da it is laid down that, when
a father sees the face of a living son, he pays a debt in him, and
gains immortality. In Sanskrit works, P&#363;tra, or son, is defined as
one who delivers a parent from a hell called put, into which those who
have no son fall. Hence the anxiety of Hindus to marry, and beget male
offspring.</p>
<p>A few years ago, in the Mysore Province, two men were charged with
the kidnapping and murder of a female infant, and one was sentenced to
transportation for life. The theory of the prosecution was that the
child was killed, in order that it might be offered as a sacrifice with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>the object of securing hidden treasure, which
was believed to be buried near the scene of the murder. A witness gave
evidence to the effect that the second accused was the p&#363;j&#257;ri
(priest) of a Gangamma temple. He used to tell people that there was
hidden treasure, and that, if a human sacrifice were offered, the
treasure might be acquired. He used to make p&#363;ja, and tie yantrams
(charms). He also made special p&#363;jas, and exorcised devils.
Another witness testified that her mother had buried some treasure
during her lifetime, and she asked the p&#363;j&#257;ri to discover it.
He came to her house, made an earthen image, and did p&#363;ja to it.
He dug the ground in three places, but no treasure was found. In
dealing with the evidence in the Court of Appeal, the Judges stated
that &ldquo;it is well known that ignorant persons have various
superstitions about the discovery of hidden treasure, and the facts
that the second accused either shared such superstitious beliefs, or
traded on the credulity of his neighbours by his pretensions of special
occult power, and that a Sany&#257;si (religious mendicant) had some
four years ago given out that treasure might be discovered by means of
a human sacrifice, cannot justify any inference that the second accused
would have acted on the last suggestion, especially when the witnesses
cannot even say that the second accused heard the Sany&#257;si&rsquo;s
suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temple was searched, and the following articles were
found:&mdash;three roots of the banyan tree having suralay (coil), a
suralay of the banyan tree, round which two roots were entwined, a
piece of banyan root, and a wheel (alada chakra) made of banyan root.
Besides, there were a copper armlet, copper thyati (charm cylinder),
nine copper plates, on which letters were engraved, a copper mokka
mattoo (copper plate bearing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>figures of deities), a piece of
thread coloured red, white and black, for tying yantrams, a tin case
containing kappu (a black substance), a ball of human hair, and a
pen-knife. There was also a dealwood box containing books and papers
relating to bh&#363;ta vidya (black art).</p>
<p>A man was accused in 1907, in the Kurnool district, of stabbing a
supposed wizard in the darkest hours of a new-moon night. In the course
of his judgment, the Judge stated that &ldquo;what may be taken as the
facts of the case are very curious. The accused and his elder brother
saw an &lsquo;iguana&rsquo; (lizard) run from the foot of a hill. This
is supposed to be one of the signs of buried treasure. They killed the
animal (and ate it eventually), and dug, and found, where it had slept,
treasure in the shape of a pot full of old-time pagodas (gold coins).
Now a goddess (called here Shatti, <i>i.e.</i>, Sakti) is supposed to
guard such buried treasure, and the finder ought to sacrifice a cock to
the goddess before receiving the treasure. The brother of the accused
neglected to do so, and came to the deceased, who was supposed to be a
warlock, though his wife represents him to be merely a worshipper of
V&#299;ra Brahma, and a distributor of holy water (thirtham) and holy
ashes to people possessed with devils. The deceased gave holy water to
Pedda Pichivadu to avert ill-luck, but the man suddenly died from
running a thorn into his foot, and his leg swelling in consequence.
About the same time, the accused&rsquo;s younger brother got palsy in
his head, and the deceased failed to cure him, though he made the
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Girigehalli in the Anantapur district, there is a temple,
concerning which the story goes that the stomach of the goddess was
once opened by an avaricious individual, who expected to find treasure
within it. The goddess appeared to him in a dream, and said that he
should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>suffer like pain to that which he had inflicted
upon her, and he shortly afterwards died of some internal
complaint.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3744src" href="#xd26e3744" name=
"xd26e3744src">24</a></p>
<p>In the Cuddapah district, many of the inhabitants are said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3749src" href="#xd26e3749" name=
"xd26e3749src">25</a> to believe that there is much treasure hidden
from the troublous days of the eighteenth century, but they have a
superstitious dread against looking for it, since the successful finder
would be smitten by the guardian demon with a sudden and painful
death.</p>
<p>The P&#257;nos (hill weavers) of Ganjam are said, on more than one
occasion, to have rifled the grave of a European, in the belief that
buried treasure would be found.</p>
<p>Many years ago, a woman was supposed to be possessed with a devil,
and an exorcist was consulted, who declared that a human sacrifice was
necessary. A victim was selected, and made very drunk. His head was cut
off, and the blood, mixed with rice, was offered to the idol. The body
was then hacked so as to deceive the police, and thrown into a
pond.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3756src" href="#xd26e3756" name=
"xd26e3756src">26</a></p>
<p>At a village near Berhampur in Ganjam, Mr S. P. Rice tells
us,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3762src" href="#xd26e3762" name=
"xd26e3762src">27</a> a number of villagers went out together. By and
bye, according to a preconcerted plan, one of the party suggested a
drink. The intended victim was drugged, and taken along to the statue
of the goddess, or shrine containing what did duty for the statue. He
was then thrown down with his face on the ground in an attitude
suggesting supplication, and, while he was still in a state of stupor,
his head was chopped off with an axe.</p>
<p>It is narrated by Chevers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3767src" href=
"#xd26e3767" name="xd26e3767src">28</a> that, in 1840, a religious
mendicant, on his way back from R&#257;m&#275;svaram, located himself
in a village near Ramn&#257;d, and gave himself out <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>to
be gifted with the power of working miracles. One evening, the
chucklers (leather-workers) of the village, observing crows and
vultures hovering near a group of trees, and suspecting that there was
carrion for them to feast upon, were tempted to visit the spot, where
they found a corpse, mangled most fearfully, and with the left hand and
right leg cut off. Many nails were driven into the head, a garland was
placed round the neck, and the forehead smeared with sandal paste. It
was rumoured that a certain person was ailing, and that the holy man
decreed that nothing short of a human sacrifice could save him, and
that the victim should bear his name. The holy man disappeared, but was
captured shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>A copper-plate grant, acquired a few years ago at Tirupati, and
believed to be a forgery, records that a temple car was made for the
goddess K&#257;likad&#275;vi of Conjeeveram by certain Panch&#257;lans
(members of the artisan classes). While it was being taken to the
temple, a magician stopped it by means of incantations. The help of
another magician was sought, and he cut off the head of his pregnant
daughter, suspended it to the car, and performed certain rites. The car
then moved, and the woman, whose head was cut off, was brought back to
life. A somewhat similar legend is recorded in another copper-plate
grant discovered in 1910 in the North Arcot district, which is also
believed to be a forgery. It is there stated that the five castes of
artisans made a bell-metal car for the K&#257;m&#257;kshiamman temple
at Conjeeveram. Members of these five castes, belonging to the
left-hand faction, commenced to drag it, but Seniyasingapuli, belonging
to the right-hand faction, by means of magical powers, raised a
thousand evil spirits against each wheel, and arrested its progress. A
woman, named Mangammal, offered to sacrifice her son, and the artisans
accordingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>purchased the boy, saying that they would give
her a head equal to that of a new-born child. Eventually, Mangammal
herself laid down before the car. Her head was cut off, and hung at the
top of the car. Her abdomen was torn open, and the f&oelig;tus removed
therefrom, and dedicated to the evil spirit. The headless trunk was
buried in the path of the wheels. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some of the cases here brought together serve as an
illustration of the difficulty which frequently arises in arriving at a
decision as to how far the taking of human life is justified as being
carried out in accordance with a genuine superstitious belief, and when
the act renders the perpetrator thereof liable to punishment under the
Indian Penal Code.</p>
<p>Five persons were charged a few years ago at the Coimbatore sessions
with the murder of a young woman. The theory put forward by the
prosecution was that two of the accused practised sorcery, and were
under the delusion that, if they could obtain the f&oelig;tus from the
uterus of a woman who was carrying her first child, they would be able
to work some wonderful spells with it. With this object, they entered
into a conspiracy with the three other accused to murder a young
married woman, aged about seventeen, who was seven months advanced in
pregnancy, and brutally murdered her, cutting open the uterus, removing
the f&oelig;tus contained therein, and stealing her jewels. The five
accused persons (three men and two women) were all of different castes.
Two of the men had been jointly practising sorcery for some years. It
was proved that, about two years before, they had performed an
incantation near a river with some raw beef, doing p&#363;ja (worship)
near the water&rsquo;s edge in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"
href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>state of nature. Evidence was
produced to prove that two of the accused decamped after the murder
with a suspicious bundle, a few days before an eclipse of the moon, to
Tirucheng&#333;du where there is a celebrated temple. It was suggested
that the bundle contained the uterus, and was taken to
Tirucheng&#333;du for the purpose of performing magical rites. When the
quarters in which two of the accused lived were searched, three
palm-leaf books were found containing mantrams regarding the pilli
suniyam, a process of incantation by means of which sorcerers are
supposed to be able to kill people. The record of the case states that
&ldquo;there can be little doubt that the first and fourth accused were
taken into the conspiracy in order to decoy the deceased. The
inducement offered to them was most probably immense wealth by the
working of charms by the second and third accused with the aid of the
f&oelig;tus. The medical evidence showed that the dead woman was
pregnant, and that, after her throat had been cut, the uterus was taken
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1829, several Natives of Malabar were charged with having
proceeded, in company with a Paraiyan magician, to the house of a
pregnant woman, who was beaten and otherwise ill-treated, and with
having taken the f&oelig;tus out of her uterus, and introduced in lieu
thereof the skin of a calf and an earthen pot. The prisoners confessed
before the police, but were acquitted mainly on the ground that the
earthen pot was of a size which rendered it impossible to credit its
introduction during life. The Paraiyas of Malabar and Cochin are
celebrated for their magical powers, and the practice of odi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; Mr Govinda Nambiar
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3793src" href="#xd26e3793" name=
"xd26e3793src">1</a> &ldquo;certain specialists among mantrav&#257;dis
(dealers in magical spells), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>who are known as Odiyans.
Conviction is deep-rooted that they have the power of destroying
whomever they please, and that, by means of a powerful bewitching
matter called pilla thilum (oil extracted from the body of an infant),
they are enabled to transform themselves into any shape or form, or
even to vanish into air, as their fancy may suggest. When an Odiyan is
hired to cause the death of a man, he waits during the night at the
gate of his intended victim&rsquo;s house, usually in the form of a
bullock. If, however, the person is inside the house, the Odiyan
assumes the shape of a cat, enters the house, and induces him to come
out. He is subsequently knocked down and strangled. The Odiyan is also
credited with the power, by means of certain medicines, of inducing
sleeping persons to open the doors, and come out of their houses as
somnambulists do. Pregnant women are sometimes induced to come out of
their houses in this way, and they are murdered, and the f&oelig;tus
extracted from them. Murder of both sexes by Odiyans was a crime of
frequent occurrence before the British occupation of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a case which was tried at the Malabar Sessions a few years ago,
several witnesses for the prosecution deposed that a certain individual
was killed by odi. One man gave the following account of the process.
Shoot the victim in the nape of the neck with a blunt arrow, and bring
him down. Proceed to beat him systematically all over the body with two
sticks (resembling a policeman&rsquo;s truncheon, and called odivaddi),
laying him on his back and applying the sticks to his chest, and up and
down the sides, breaking all the ribs and other bones. Then raise the
person, and <span class="corr" id="xd26e3803" title=
"Source: kicks">kick</span> his sides. After this, force him to take an
oath that he will never divulge the names of his torturer. All the
witnesses agreed about the blunt arrow, and some bore testimony to the
sticks.</p>
<p>A detailed account of the odi cult, from which the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>following information was obtained, is given by
Mr Anantha Krishna Iyer.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3810src" href=
"#xd26e3810" name="xd26e3810src">2</a> The disciple is taught how to
procure pilla thilum (f&oelig;tus oil) from the six or seven months
f&oelig;tus of a young woman in her first pregnancy. He (the Paraiyan
magician) sets out at midnight from his hut to the house of the woman
he has selected, round which he walks several times, shaking a cocoanut
containing gurasi (a compound of water, lime, and turmeric), and
muttering some mantrams to invoke the aid of his deity. He also draws a
yantram (cabalistic figure) on the earth, taking special care to
observe the omens as he starts. Should they be unfavourable, he puts it
off for a more favourable opportunity. By the potency of his cult, the
woman is made to come out. Even if the door of the room in which she
might sleep be under lock and key, she would knock her head against it
until she found her way out. She thus comes out, and yields herself to
the influence of the magician, who leads her to a retired spot either
in the compound (grounds), or elsewhere in the neighbourhood, strips
her naked, and tells her to lie flat. She does so, and a chora kindi
(gourd, <i>Lagenaria</i>) is placed close to the uterus. The
f&oelig;tus comes out in a moment. A few leaves of some plant are
applied, and the uterus contracts. Sometimes the womb is filled with
rubbish, and the woman instantly dies. Care is taken that the
f&oelig;tus does not touch the ground, lest the purpose be defeated,
and the efficacy of the medicine completely lost. It is cut into
pieces, dried, and afterwards exposed to the smoke above a fireplace.
It is then placed in a vessel provided with a hole or two, below which
there is another vessel. The two together are placed in a larger vessel
filled with water, and heated over a bright fire. The heat must be so
intense as to affect the f&oelig;tus, from which a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>kind
of liquid drops, and collects in the second vessel in an hour and a
half. The magician then takes a human skull, and reduces it to a fine
powder. This is mixed with a portion of the liquid. A mark is made on
the forehead with this mixture, and the oil is rubbed on certain parts
of the body, and he drinks some cow-dung water. He then thinks that he
can assume the figure of any animal he likes, and successfully achieves
the object in view, which is generally to murder or maim a person. A
magic oil, called angola thilum, is extracted from the angola tree
(<i>Alangium Lamarckii</i>), which bears a very large number of fruits.
One of these is believed to be capable of descending and returning to
its position on dark nights. Its possession can be secured by demons,
or by an expert watching at the foot of the tree. When it has been
secured, the extraction of the oil involves the same operations as
those for extracting the pilla thilum, and they must be carried out
within seven hours. The odi cult is said to have been practised by the
Paraiyas some twenty years ago to a very large extent in the rural
parts of the northern division of the Cochin State, and in the
t&#257;luks of Palgh&#257;t and Valuvan&#257;d, and even now it has not
quite died out. Cases of extracting the f&oelig;tus, and of putting
persons to death by odi, are not now heard of owing to the fear of
government officials, landlords, and others.</p>
<p>Of the odi cult as practised by the P&#257;nan magicians of the
Cochin State, the following account is given by Mr Anantha Krishna
Iyer.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3823src" href="#xd26e3823" name=
"xd26e3823src">3</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A P&#257;nan, who is an adept in the black art,
dresses in an unwashed cloth, and performs p&#363;ja to his deity,
after which he goes in search of a kotuveli plant (<i>Plumbago
zeylanica</i>). When he has found it, he goes round it three times
every day, and continues to do so for ninety days, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>prostrating himself every day before it, and on
the last night, which must be a new moon night, at midnight, he
performs p&#363;ja to the plant, burning camphor and frankincense, and,
after going round it three times, prostrates himself before it. He then
thrusts three small candles on it, and advances twenty paces in front
of it. With his mouth closed, he plucks the root, and buries it in the
ashes on the cremation ground, after which he pours the water of seven
green cocoanuts on it. He then goes round it twenty-one times, uttering
all the while certain mantrams. This being over, he plunges himself in
water, and stands erect until it extends to his mouth. He takes a
mouthful of water which he empties on the spot, and takes the plant
with the root which he believes to possess peculiar virtues. When it is
taken to the closed door of a house, it has the power to entice a
pregnant woman, and cause her to come out, when the f&oelig;tus is
removed. It is all secretly done at midnight. The head, hands, and legs
are cut off, and the trunk is taken to a dark-coloured rock, on which
it is cut into nine pieces, which are burned until they are blackened.
At this stage one piece boils, and it is placed in a new earthen pot,
to which is added the water of nine green cocoanuts. The pot is removed
to the burial ground, where the P&#257;nan performs a p&#363;ja in
honour of his favourite deity. He fixes two poles deep in the earth, at
a distance of thirty feet from each other. The two poles are connected
by a strong wire, from which is suspended the pot to be heated and
boiled. Seven fireplaces are made beneath the wire, over the middle of
which is the pot. The branches of bamboo, katalati (<i>Achyranthes
aspera</i>), conga (<i>Bauhinia variegata</i>), cocoanut palm, jack
tree (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>), and pavatta (<i>Pavetta
indica</i>), are used in forming a bright fire. The mixture in the pot
soon boils and becomes oily, at which stage it is passed through a fine
cloth. The oil is preserved, and a mark made with it on the forehead
enables the possessor to realise anything which is thought of. The
sorcerer must be in a state of vow for twenty-one days, and live on a
diet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>of chama kanji (gruel). The deity whose aid is
necessary is also propitiated by offerings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1908, the following case, relating to the birth of a monster, was
tried before the Sessions Judge of South Canara. A young Gauda girl
became pregnant by her brother-in-law. After three days&rsquo; labour,
the child was born. The accused, who was the mother of the girl, was
the midwife. Finding the delivery very difficult, she sent for a person
to come and help her. The child was, as they thought, still-born. On
its head was a red protuberance like a ball; round each of its forearms
were two or three red bands; the eyes and ears were fixed very high in
the head; and the eyes, nose, and mouth were abnormally large. The
mother was carried out of the outhouse, lest the devil child should do
her harm, or kill her. The accused summoned a Muhammadan, who was in
the yard. He came in, and she showed him the child, and asked him to
call the neighbours, to decide what to do. The child, she said, was a
devil child, and must be cut and killed, lest it should devour the
mother. While they were looking at the child, it began to move and roll
its eyes about, and turn on the ground. It is a belief of the villagers
that such a devil child, when brought in contact with the air, rapidly
grows, and causes great trouble, usually killing the mother, and
sometimes killing all the inmates of the house. The accused told the
Muhammadan to cover the child with a vessel, which he did. Then there
was a sound from inside the vessel, either of the child moving, or
making a sound with its mouth. The accused then put her hand under the
vessel, dragged the child half-way out, and, while the Muhammadan
pressed the edge of the vessel on the abdomen of the child, took a
knife, and cut the body in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>half. When the body was cut in
two, there was no blood, but a mossy-green or black liquid oozed out.
The accused got two areca leaves, and put one piece of the child on
one, and one on the other, and told the Muhammadan to get a spade, and
bury them. So they went to the jungle close to the house, and the
Muhammadan dug two holes, one on one hillock, and one on another. In
these holes, the two pieces of the child were buried. The object of
this was to prevent the two pieces joining together again, in which
case the united devil child would have come out of the grave, and gone
to kill the mother.</p>
<p>Years ago, it was not unusual for people to come long distances for
the purpose of engaging Paniyans of the Wyn&#257;d (in Malabar) to help
them in carrying out some more than usually desperate robbery or
murder. Their mode of procedure, when engaged in an enterprise of this
sort, is evidenced by two cases, which had in them a strong element of
savagery. On both these occasions, the thatched homesteads were
surrounded at dead of night by gangs of Paniyans carrying large bundles
of rice straw. After carefully piling up the straw on all sides of the
building marked for destruction, torches were at a given signal
applied, and those of the inmates who attempted to escape were knocked
on the head with clubs, and thrust into the fiery furnace. In 1904,
some Paniyans were employed by a M&#257;ppilla (Muhammadan) to murder
his mistress, who was pregnant, and threatened that she would noise
abroad his responsibility for her condition. He brooded over the
matter, and one day, meeting a Paniyan, promised him ten rupees if he
would kill the woman. The Paniyan agreed to commit the crime, and went
with his brothers to a place on a hill, where the M&#257;ppilla and the
woman were in the habit of gratifying their passions. Thither the man
and woman followed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232"
name="pb232">232</a>]</span>the Paniyans, of whom one ran out, and
struck the victim on the head with a chopper. She was then gagged with
a cloth, carried some distance, and killed.</p>
<p>In 1834, the inhabitants of several villages in Malabar attacked a
village of Paraiyans on the alleged ground that deaths of people and
cattle, and the protracted labour of a woman in childbed, had been
caused by the practice of sorcery by the Paraiyans. They were beaten
inhumanely with their hands tied behind their backs, so that several
died. The villagers were driven, bound, into a river, immersed under
water so as nearly to produce suffocation, and their own children were
forced to rub sand into their wounds. Their settlement was then razed
to the ground, and they were driven into banishment.</p>
<p>The K&#257;dirs of the &#256;naimalais are believers in witchcraft,
and attribute diseases to the working thereof. They are expert
exorcists, and trade in mantrav&#257;dam or magic. It is recorded by Mr
Logan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3863src" href="#xd26e3863" name=
"xd26e3863src">4</a> that &ldquo;the family of famous trackers, whose
services in the jungles were retained for H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales&rsquo;s (afterwards King Edward VII.) projected sporting tour in
the &#256;namalai mountains, dropped off most mysteriously one by one,
stricken down by an unseen hand, and all of them expressing beforehand
their conviction that they were under a certain individual&rsquo;s
spell, and were doomed to certain death at an early date. They were
probably poisoned, but how it was managed remains a mystery, although
the family was under the protection of a European gentleman, who would
at once have brought to light any ostensible foul play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Badagas of the N&#299;lgiris live in dread of the jungle
Kurumbas, who constantly come under reference in their folk-stories.
The Kurumba is the necromancer of the hills, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>and
believed to be possessed of the power of outraging women, removing
their livers, and so causing their death, while the wound heals by
magic, so that no trace of the operation is left. The Badaga&rsquo;s
dread of the Kurumba is said to be so great, that a simple threat of
vengeance has proved fatal. The Badaga or Toda requires the services of
the Kurumba, when he fancies that any member of his family is possessed
by a devil. The Kurumba does his best to remove the malady by means of
mantrams (magical formul&aelig;). If he fails, and if any suspicion is
aroused in the mind of the Badaga or Toda that he is allowing the devil
to play his pranks instead of loosing his hold on the supposed victim,
woe betide him. Writing in 1832, Harkness states<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3870src" href="#xd26e3870" name="xd26e3870src">5</a> that
&ldquo;a very few years before, a Burgher (Badaga) had been hanged by
the sentence of the provincial court for the murder of a Kurumba. The
act of the former was not without what was considered great
provocation. Disease had attacked the inhabitants of the hamlet, a
murrain their cattle. The former had carried off a great part of the
family of the murderer, and he himself had but narrowly escaped its
effects. No one in the neighbourhood doubted that the Kurumba in
question had, by his necromancy, caused all this misfortune, and, after
several fruitless attempts, a party of them succeeded in surrounding
him in open day, and effecting their purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1835, no less than fifty-eight Kurumbas were murdered, and a
smaller number in 1875 and 1882. In 1891, the inmates of a single
Kurumba hut were said to have been murdered, and the hut burnt to
ashes, because one of the family had been treating a sick Badaga child,
and failed to cure it. The district judge, however, disbelieved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>the evidence, and all who were charged were
acquitted. Again, in 1900, a whole family of Kurumbas was murdered, of
which the head, who had a reputation as a medicine man, was believed to
have brought disease and death into a Badaga village. The sympathies of
the whole countryside were so strongly with the murderers that
detection was made very difficult, and the persons charged were
acquitted.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3877src" href="#xd26e3877" name=
"xd26e3877src">6</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mr Grigg writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3883src" href="#xd26e3883" name="xd26e3883src">7</a>
&ldquo;a curious fact that neither Kota, Irula, or Badaga, will slay a
Kurumba, until a Toda has struck the first blow, but, as soon as his
sanctity has been violated by a blow, they hasten to complete the
murderous work, which the sacred hand of the Toda has begun.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some years ago, a Toda was found dead in a sitting posture on the
top of a hill near a Badaga village, in which a party of Todas had gone
to collect the tribute due to them. The body was cremated, and a report
made to the police that the man had been murdered. On enquiry, it was
ascertained that the dead man was supposed to have bewitched a little
Badaga girl, who died in consequence, and the presumption was that he
had been murdered by the Badagas out of spite.</p>
<p>In 1906, two men were found guilty of killing a man by shooting him
with a gun in South Canara. It is recorded in the judgment that
&ldquo;the accused have a brother, who has been ill for a long time.
They thought deceased, who was an astrologer and mantrav&#257;di, had
bewitched him. They had spent fifty or sixty rupees on deceased for his
treatment, but it did no good, and accused came to believe that
deceased not only would not cure their brother himself, but would not
allow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>other doctors to do so. Also, a certain theft
having occurred some months ago, deceased professed by his magic arts
to have discovered that accused and others were the thieves. In
consequence of these things, accused had expressed various threats
against deceased. One witness, who is a mantrav&#257;di in a small way,
was consulted by one of the accused to find some counter-treatment for
deceased&rsquo;s bewitchment. Accused said that deceased refused to
cure their brother, and would not let others do so, unless they gave
him certain gold coins called R&#257;ma Tanka, said to be in their
possession. They desired this possession, so would not satisfy
deceased. So their brother was dying by inches under deceased&rsquo;s
malign influence. This witness professed to have discovered that
accused&rsquo;s brother was being worried by one black devil and two
malignant spirits of the dead. It is clear from the evidence that
accused, who are ignorant men of a low type, really believed that
deceased was by his magic wilfully and slowly killing their brother.
They believed that the only way to save their brother&rsquo;s life was
to kill the magician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During an epidemic of smallpox in the Jeypore hill tracts, a man
lost his wife and child. A local subscription had been organised for a
sorcerer, on the understanding that he was to stay the course of the
epidemic. The bereaved man charged him with being a fraud, and, in the
course of a quarrel, split his skull open with a tangi (axe).</p>
<p>In 1906, a K&#333;mati woman died of cholera in a village in Ganjam.
Her son sought the assistance of certain men of the
&ldquo;Reddika&rdquo; caste in obtaining wood for the pyre, carrying
the corpse to the burning-ground, and cremating it. The son set fire to
the pyre, and withdrew, leaving the Reddikas on the spot. Among them
was one, who is said to have learnt sorcery from a Bair&#257;gi
(religious mendicant), and to have been generally feared and hated in
the village. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>To him the spread of cholera by letting loose
the goddess of the cremation-ground, called Mashani Chendi, was
attributed. Arrack (liquor) was passed round among those who were
attending to the burning corpse, and they got more or less drunk. Two
of them killed the sorcerer by severe blows on the neck with
wood-choppers. His corpse was then placed on the burning pyre of the
K&#333;mati woman, and cremated. The men who delivered the death blows
were sentenced to transportation for life, as their intoxicated state
and superstitious feeling were held to plead in mitigation of the
punishment.</p>
<p>In 1904 a case illustrating the prevailing belief in witchcraft
occurred in the Vizagapatam hill tracts. The youngest of three brothers
died of fever, and, when the body was cremated, the fire failed to
consume the upper portion. The brothers concluded that death must have
been caused by the witchcraft of a certain Kondh. They accordingly
attacked him, and killed him. After death, the brothers cut the body in
half and dragged the upper half of it to their own village, where they
attempted to nail it up on the spot where their deceased
brother&rsquo;s body failed to burn. They were arrested on the spot,
with the fragment of the Kondh&rsquo;s corpse. They were sentenced to
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3901src" href="#xd26e3901" name=

<p>In the North Arcot district, a few years ago, a reputed magician,
while collecting the pieces of a burning corpse, to be used for the
purposes of sorcery, was seized and murdered, and his body cast on the
burning pyre. From the recovery of duplicate bones, it was proved that
two bodies were burnt, and the murder was detected. Two persons were
sentenced to transportation for life.<a class="noteref" id=

href="#xd26e3926" name="xd26e3926src">1</a> that sorcerers usually
unite together to form a society, which may attain great influence
among backward races. In Southern India there are certain castes which
are summed up in the &ldquo;Madras Census Report,&rdquo; 1901, as
&ldquo;exorcists and devil-dancers,&rdquo; whose most important
avocation is the practice of magic. Such, for example, are the Nalkes,
Paravas, and Pompadas of South Canara, who are called in whenever a
bh&#363;tha (demon) is to be propitiated, and the P&#257;nans and
Malayans of Malabar, whose magical rites are described by me in detail
elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3929src" href="#xd26e3929" name=

<p>Concerning sorcery on the west coast, the Travancore Census
Commissioner, 1901, writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The forms of sorcery familiar to the people of
Malabar are of three kinds:&mdash;(1) kaivisham, or poisoning food by
incantations; (2) the employment of Kuttich&#257;ttan, a
mysteriously-working mischievous imp; (3) setting up spirits to haunt
men and their houses, and cause illness of all kinds. The most
mischievous imp in Malabar demonology is an annoying quip-loving little
spirit, as black as night, and about the size of a well-nourished
twelve-year-old boy. Some people say that they have seen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>him
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, having a forelock. There are Namb&#363;tiris
(Br&#257;hmans) in Malabar to whom these are so many missiles, which
they may throw at anybody they choose. They are, like
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Ariel, little active bodies, and most willing
slaves of the master under whom they happen to be placed. Their victims
suffer from unbearable agony. Their clothes take fire; their food turns
to ordure; their beverages become urine; stones fall in showers on all
sides of them, but curiously not on them; and their bed becomes a bed
of thorns. With all this annoying mischief, Kuttich&#257;ttan or Boy
Satan does no serious harm. He oppresses and harasses, but never
injures. A celebrated Br&#257;hman of Changanacheri is said to own more
than a hundred of these Ch&#257;ttans. Household articles and jewelry
of value may be left in the premises of homes guarded by Ch&#257;ttan,
and no thief dares to lay his hand on them. The invisible sentry keeps
diligent watch over his master&rsquo;s property, and has unchecked
powers of movement in any medium. As remuneration for all these
services, the Ch&#257;ttan demands nothing but food, but that in a
large measure. If starved, the Ch&#257;ttans would not hesitate to
remind the master of their power, but, if ordinarily cared for, they
would be his most willing drudges. As a safeguard against the infinite
power secured for the master by Kuttich&#257;ttan, it is laid down that
malign acts committed through his instrumentality recoil on the
prompter, who dies either childless or after frightful physical and
mental agony. Another method of oppressing humanity, believed to be in
the power of sorcerers, is to make men and women possessed with
spirits. Here, too, women are more subject to their evil influence than
men. Delayed puberty, permanent sterility, and still-births, are not
uncommon ills of a devil-possessed woman. Sometimes the spirits sought
to be exorcised refuse to leave the victim, unless the sorcerer
promises them a habitation in his own compound (grounds), and arranges
for daily offerings being given. This is agreed to as a matter of
unavoidable necessity, and money and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>lands are conferred
upon the mantrav&#257;di Namb&#363;tiri to enable him to fulfil his
promise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference has been made (p. 238) to the falling of stones round
those attacked by Ch&#257;ttans. Hysteria, epilepsy, and other
disorders, are, in Malabar, ascribed to possession by devils, who can
also cause cattle disease, accidents, and misfortunes of any kind.
Throwing stones on houses, and setting fire to the thatch, are supposed
to be their ordinary recreations. The mere mention of the name of a
certain Namb&#363;tiri family is said to be enough to drive them
away.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3949src" href="#xd26e3949" name=
"xd26e3949src">3</a> A few years ago, an old Br&#257;hman woman, in the
Bellary district, complained to the police that a S&#363;dra woman
living in her neighbourhood, and formerly employed by her as sweeper,
had been throwing stones into her house for some nights. The woman
admitted that she had done so, because she was advised by a
Ling&#257;yat priest that the remedy for intermittent fever, from which
she was suffering, was to throw stones at an old woman, and extract
some blood from her body on a new or full-moon day.</p>
<p>Some demons are believed to have human mistresses and concubines,
and it is narrated<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3957src" href=
"#xd26e3957" name="xd26e3957src">4</a> that a Chetti (merchant) in the
Tamil country purchased a Malabar demon from a magician for ninety
rupees. But hardly a day had passed before the undutiful spirit fell in
love with its new owner&rsquo;s wife, and succeeded in its nefarious
purpose.</p>
<p>Quite recently a woman, in order to win the affection of her
husband, gave him a love-charm composed of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3962" title="Source: dhatura">datura</span> in chutney. The dose
proved fatal, and she was sentenced to two years&rsquo; rigorous
imprisonment.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3965src" href="#xd26e3965"
name="xd26e3965src">5</a> A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>love-philtre, said to be composed
of the charred remains of a mouse and spider, was once sent to the
chemical examiner to Government for analysis in a suspected case of
poisoning. In connection with the dugong (<i>Halicore dugong</i>),
which is caught in the Gulf of Manaar, Dr Annandale writes as
follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3973src" href="#xd26e3973" name=
"xd26e3973src">6</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The presence of large glands in connection with
the eye afford some justification for the Malay&rsquo;s belief that the
dugong weeps when captured. They regard the tears of the &#299;kan
dugong (dugong fish) as a powerful love-charm. Muhammadan fishermen of
the Gulf of Manaar appeared to be ignorant of this usage, but told me
that a &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; once went out with them to collect the
tears of a dugong, should they capture one.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Native physicians in the Tamil country are said to prepare an
unguent, into the composition of which the eye of the slender Loris
(<i>Loris gracilis</i>), the brain of the dead offspring of a
primipara, and the catamenial blood of a young virgin, enter, as an
effective preparation in necromancy. The eye of the Loris is also used
for making a preparation, which is believed to enable the possessor to
kidnap and seduce women. The tail of a cham&aelig;leon, secured on a
Sunday, is also believed to be an excellent love-charm.</p>
<p>A young married student at a college in Madras attributed his
illness to the administration by his wife of a love-philtre containing
the brains of a baby which had been exhumed after burial. Among the
Tamil Paraiyans and some other classes, a first-born child, if it is a
male, is buried near or even within the house, so that its corpse may
not be carried away by a sorcerer, to be used in magical
rites.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3990src" href="#xd26e3990" name=
"xd26e3990src">7</a> If a first-born child dies, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>a
finger is sometimes cut off, lest a sorcerer should dig up the body,
and extract an essence (karuvu) from the brain, wherewith to harm his
enemies.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3998src" href="#xd26e3998" name=
"xd26e3998src">8</a> The Rev. J. Castets informs me that he once saw a
man being initiated into the mysteries of the magician&rsquo;s art. The
apparatus included the top of the skull of a first-born male child
inscribed with Tamil characters.</p>
<p>A station-house police officer informed Mr S. G. Roberts that
first-born children, dying in infancy, are buried near the house, lest
their heads should be used in sorcery, a sort of ink or decoction (mai)
being distilled from them. This ink is used for killing people at a
distance, or for winning a woman&rsquo;s love, or the confidence of
those from whom some favour is required. In the last two cases, the ink
is smeared over the eyebrows. It is believed that, if an infant&rsquo;s
head is used for this purpose, the mother will never have a living
child. When Mr Roberts was at Salem, he had to try a case of this
practice, and the Public Prosecutor informed him that it is believed
that, if a hole is made in the top of the head of the infant when it is
buried, it cannot be effectively used in sorcery. In the Trichinopoly
district, the police brought to Mr Roberts&rsquo; notice a
sorcerer&rsquo;s outfit, which had been seized. There were the most
frightful Tamil curses invoking devils, written backwards in
&ldquo;looking-glass characters&rdquo; on an olai (strip of palm leaf),
and a looking-glass to read them by. Spells written backwards are said
to be very potent. There was also a small round tin, containing a black
treacly paste with a sort of shine on it, which was said to have been
obtained from the head of a dead child. There is a Tamil proverb
&ldquo;Kuzhi pillai, madi pillai,&rdquo; meaning grave child, lap
child, in reference to a belief that, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>quicker a first-born
child is buried, the quicker is the next child conceived.</p>
<p>The following form of sorcery in Malabar is described by Mr
Walhouse.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4009src" href="#xd26e4009" name=
"xd26e4009src">9</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Let a sorcerer obtain the corpse of a maiden,
and on a Saturday night place it at the foot of a bhuta-haunted tree on
an altar, and repeat a hundred times: Om! Hrim! Hrom! O goddess of
Malay&#257;la who possessest us in a moment! Come! Come! The corpse
will then be inspired by a demon, and rise up; and, if the demon be
appeased with flesh and arrack (liquor), it will answer all questions
put to it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A human bone from a burial-ground, over which powerful mantrams have
been recited, if thrown into an enemy&rsquo;s house, will cause his
ruin. Ashes from the burial-ground on which an ass has been rolling on
a Saturday or Sunday, if thrown into the house of an enemy, are said to
produce severe illness, if the house is not vacated.</p>
<p>From Malabar, a correspondent writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I came across a funny thing in an embankment in
a rice-field. The tender part of a young cocoanut branch had been cut
into three strips, and the strips fastened one into the other in the
form of a triangle. At the apex a reed was stuck, and along the base
and sides small flowers, so that the thing looked like a ship in full
sail. My inspector informed me, with many blushes, that it contained a
devil, which the sorcerer of a neighbouring village had cut out of a
young girl. Mrs Bishop, in her book on Korea, mentions that the Koreans
do exactly the same thing, but, in Korea, the devil&rsquo;s prison is
laid by the wayside, and is carefully stepped over by every passer-by,
whereas the one I saw was carefully avoided by my peons (orderlies) and
others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the God&#257;vari district, Mr H. Tyler came across the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>burning funeral pyre of a Koyi girl, who had
died of syphilis. Across a neighbouring path leading to the Koyi
village was a basket fish-trap containing grass, and on each side
thorny twigs, which were intended to catch the malign spirit of the
dead girl, and prevent it from entering the village. The twigs and trap
containing the spirit were to be burnt on the following day. By the
D&#333;mbs of Vizagapatam, the souls of the dead are believed to roam
about, so as to cause all possible harm to mankind, and also to protect
them against the attacks of witches. A place is prepared for the
D&#363;ma in the door-hinge, or a fishing-net, wherein he lives, is
placed over the door. The witches must count all the knots of the net,
before they can enter the house.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4032src"
href="#xd26e4032" name="xd26e4032src">10</a></p>
<p>At cross-roads in the Bellary district, geometric patterns are
sometimes made at night by people suffering from disease, in the belief
that the affliction will pass to the person who first treads on the
charm.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4037src" href="#xd26e4037" name=
"xd26e4037src">11</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At cross-roads in the South Arcot district may
be sometimes seen pieces of broken pot, saffron (turmeric), etc. These
are traces of the following method of getting rid of an obstinate
disease. A new pot is washed clean, and filled with a number of objects
(the prescription differs in different localities), such as turmeric,
coloured grains of rice, chillies, cotton-seed, and so forth, and
sometimes a light made of a few threads dipped in a little dish of oil,
and taken at dead of night to the cross-roads, and broken there. The
disease will then disappear. In some places it is believed that it
passes to the first person who sees the d&eacute;bris of the ceremony
the next morning, and the performer has to be careful to carry it out
unknown to his neighbours, or the consequences are unpleasant for
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4043src" href="#xd26e4043" name=
"xd26e4043src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some Valaiyans, Paraiyans, and Kallans, on the occasion of a death
in the family, place a pot filled with dung or water, a broomstick, and
a firebrand, at some place where three roads meet, or in front of the
house, to prevent the ghost from returning.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4049src" href="#xd26e4049" name="xd26e4049src">13</a> When a
Paraiyan man dies, camphor is burnt, not at the house, but at the
junction of three lanes.</p>
<p>In the God&#257;vari district, a sorcerer known as the Ejjugadu
(male physician) is believed, out of spite or in return for payment, to
kill another by invoking the gods. He goes to a green tree, and there
spreads muggu or chunam (lime) powder, and places an effigy of the
intended victim thereon. He also places a bow and arrow there, recites
certain spells, and calls on the gods. The victim is said to die in a
couple of days. But, if he understands that the Ejjugadu has thus
invoked the gods, he may inform another Ejjugadu, who will carry out
similar operations under another tree. His bow and arrow will go to
those of the first Ejjugadu, and the two bows and arrows will fight as
long as the spell remains. The man will then be safe.</p>
<p>Writing concerning the nomad Yerukalas, Mr F. Fawcett says<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4056src" href="#xd26e4056" name=
"xd26e4056src">14</a> that &ldquo;the warlock takes the possessed one
by night to the outskirts of the village, and makes a figure on the
ground with powdered rice, powders of various colours, and powdered
charcoal. Balls of the powders, half cocoanut shells, betel, four-anna
pieces, and oil lamps, are placed on the hands, legs, and abdomen. A
little heap of boiled rice is placed near the feet, and curds and
vegetables are set on the top of it, with limes placed here and there.
The subject of the incantation sits near the head, while the magician
mutters mantrams. A he-goat is then <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>sacrificed. Its head
is placed near the foot of the figure, and benzoin and camphor are
waved. A little grain is scattered about the figure to appease the evil
spirits. Some arrack is poured into a cup, which is placed on the body
of the figure, and the bottle which contained it is left on the head.
The limes are cut in two, and two cocoanuts are broken. The patient
then walks by the left side of the figure to its legs, takes one step
to the right towards the head, and one step to the left towards the
feet, and walks straight home without looking back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Malabar, Mr Govinda Nambiar writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4065src" href="#xd26e4065" name="xd26e4065src">15</a> &ldquo;when
a village doctor attending a sick person finds that the malady is
unknown to him, or will not yield to his remedies, he calls in the
astrologer, and subsequently the exorcist, to expel the demon or demons
which have possessed the sick man. If the devils will not yield to
ordinary remedies administered by his disciples, the mantrav&#257;di
himself comes, and a devil dance is appointed to be held on a certain
day. Thereat various figures of mystic device are traced on the ground,
and in their midst a huge and frightful form representing the demon.
Sometimes an effigy is constructed out of cooked and coloured rice. The
patient is seated near the head of the figure, and opposite sits the
magician adorned with bundles of sticks tied over the joints of his
body, tails, and skins of animals, etc. Verses are chanted, and
sometimes cocks are sacrificed, and the blood is sprinkled on the
demon&rsquo;s effigy. Amidst the beating of drums and blowing of pipes,
the magician enters upon his diabolical dance, and, in the midst of his
paroxysm, may even bite live cocks, and suck with ferocity the hot
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a Malayan exorcist is engaged in propitiating a demon, a fowl
is sometimes waved before him, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>decapitated. He puts the neck
in his mouth, and sucks the blood. By the Tiyans of Malabar a number of
evil spirits are supposed to devote their attention to a pregnant
woman, and to suck the blood of the child <i>in utero</i>, and of the
mother. In the process of expelling them, the woman lies on the ground
and kicks. A cock is thrust into her hand, and she bites it, and drinks
its blood.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer that by the Thanda
Pulayans of the west coast &ldquo;a ceremony called urasikotukkuka is
performed with the object of getting rid of a devil, with which a
person is possessed. At a place far distant from the hut, a leaf, on
which the blood of a fowl has been made to fall, is spread on the
ground. On a smaller leaf, chunam and turmeric are placed. The person
who first sets eyes on these becomes possessed by the devil, and sets
free the individual who was previously under its influence. The Thanda
Pulayans also practise maranakriyas, or sacrifices to demons, to bring
about the death of an enemy. Sometimes affliction is supposed to be
brought about by the enmity of those who have got incantations written
on a palm leaf, and buried in the ground near a house by the side of a
well. A sorcerer is called in to counteract the evil charm, which he
digs up and destroys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Paraiyas of Travancore,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4081src" href="#xd26e4081" name="xd26e4081src">16</a> the Rev. S.
Mateer writes that S&#363;dras and Sh&#257;nars<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4086src" href="#xd26e4086" name="xd26e4086src">17</a> frequently
employ the Paraiya devil-dancers and sorcerers to search for and dig
out magical charms buried in the earth by enemies, and counteract their
enchantments.</p>
<p>A form of sorcery in Malabar called marana (destruction)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>is said by Mr Fawcett<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4094src" href="#xd26e4094" name="xd26e4094src">18</a> to be
carried out in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A figure representing the enemy to be destroyed
is drawn on a small plate of metal (gold by preference), and to it some
mystic diagrams are added. It is then addressed with a statement that
bodily injury, or the death of the person, shall take place at a
certain time. This little sheet is wrapped up in another metal sheet or
leaf (of gold if possible), and buried in some place which the person
to be injured or destroyed is in the habit of passing. Should he pass
over the place, it is supposed that the charm will take effect at the
time named.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One favourite tantra of the South Indian sorcerer is said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4105src" href="#xd26e4105" name=
"xd26e4105src">19</a> to consist of &ldquo;what is popularly known in
Tamil as pavai, that is to say, a doll made of some plastic substance,
such as clay or wheat-flour. A crude representation of the intended
victim is obtained by moulding a quantity of the material, and a nail
or pin is driven into it at a spot corresponding to the limb or organ
that is intended to be affected.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4110src"
href="#xd26e4110" name="xd26e4110src">20</a> For instance, if there is
to be paralysis of the right arm, the pin is stuck into the right arm
of the image; if madness is to result, it is driven into the head, and
so on, appropriate mantras being chanted over the image, which is
buried at midnight in a neighbouring cremation ground. So long as the
pavai is underground, the victim will grow from bad to worse, and may
finally succumb, if steps are not taken in time. Sometimes, instead of
a doll being used, the corpse of a child recently buried is dug out of
the ground, and re-interred after being similarly treated. The only
remedy consists in another sorcerer being called in for the purpose of
digging out the pavai. Various are the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>methods he adopts for
discovering the place where the doll is buried, one of them being very
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4118" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> to what is known as crystal-gazing. A
small quantity of a specially prepared thick black fluid is placed on
the palm of a third person, and the magician professes to find out
every circumstance connected with the case of his client&rsquo;s mental
or physical condition by attentively looking at it. The place of the
doll&rsquo;s burial is spotted with remarkable precision, the nail or
pin extracted, and the patient is restored to his normal condition as
by a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following form of sorcery resorted to in Malabar in compassing
the discomfiture of an enemy is recorded by Mr Walhouse.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4123src" href="#xd26e4123" name=
"xd26e4123src">21</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Make an image of wax in the form of your enemy;
take it in your right hand at night, and hold your chain of beads in
your left hand. Then burn the image with due rites, and it shall slay
your enemy in a fortnight. Or a figure representing an enemy, with his
name and date of his birth inscribed on it, is carved out of
<i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i> wood. A mantram is recited, a fowl offered
up, and the figure buried in glowing rice-husk embers. Or, again, some
earth from a spot where an enemy has urinated, saliva expectorated by
him, and a small tuft of hair, are placed inside a tender cocoanut, and
enclosed in a piece of <i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>. The cocoanut is
pierced with twenty-one nails and buried, and a fowl
sacrificed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A police inspector, when visiting a village a few years ago, was
told by one of the villagers that a man was going to bury two wax
dolls, in order to cause his death. The inspector accordingly went to
the house of the suspected enemy, where he found the two dolls, and
some books on witchcraft.</p>

<p>The Native servant of a friend in Madras found buried <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>in a
corner of his master&rsquo;s garden the image of a human figure, which
had been deposited there by an enemy who wished to injure him. The
figure was made of flour, mixed with &ldquo;walking foot earth,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, earth from the ground, which the servant had walked over.
Nails, fourteen in number, had been driven into the head, neck, and
each shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle. Buried with the
figure were fourteen eggs, limes, and balls of camphor, and a scrap of
paper bearing the age of the servant, and the names of his father and
mother. A Muhammadan fortune-teller advised the servant to burn the
image, so at midnight he made an offering of a sheep, camphor, betel
nuts, and cocoanuts, and performed the cremation ceremony.</p>
<p>In 1903, a life-size nude female human figure with feet everted and
directed backwards, carved out of the soft wood of <i>Alstonia
scholaris</i>, was washed ashore at Calicut in Malabar. Long nails had
been driven in all over the head, body, and limbs, and a large square
hole cut out above the navel. Inscriptions in Arabic characters were
scrawled over it. By a coincidence, the corpse of a man was washed
ashore close to the figure. Possibly it represented the figure of a
woman who was possessed by an evil spirit, which was attached to it by
a nail between the legs before it was cast into the sea, and was made
on the Laccadive islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4160src" href=

"xd26e4163src" href="#xd26e4163" name="xd26e4163src">23</a> that the
figure may represent some notorious witch; that the nails were driven
into it, and the mutilation made in order to injure her, and the spells
added to destroy her magical powers; finally, that the image was cast
into the sea as a means of getting rid of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>sorceress. There is a tradition that the goddess
Bhagavati, who is worshipped at <span class="corr" id="xd26e4170"
title="Source: Kodungallur">Kodungall&#363;r</span> in Malabar, was
rescued by a fisherman when she was shut up in a jar, and thrown into
the sea by a great magician. The Lingadars of the Kistna district are
said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4174src" href="#xd26e4174" name=
"xd26e4174src">24</a> to have made a specialty of bottling evil
spirits, and casting the bottles away in some place where no one is
likely to come across them, and liberate them.</p>
<p>A few years ago, another wooden representation of a human being was
washed ashore at Calicut. The figure is 11 inches in height. The arms
are bent on the chest, and the palms of the hands are placed together
as in the act of saluting. A square cavity, closed by a wooden lid, has
been cut out of the abdomen, and contains apparently tobacco, ganja
(Indian hemp), and hair. An iron bar has been driven from the back of
the head through the body, and terminates in the abdominal cavity. A
sharp cutting instrument has been driven into the chest and back in
twelve places.</p>
<p>A life-size female figure, rudely scratched on a plank of wood, with
Arabic inscriptions scrawled on it, and riddled with nails, was washed
ashore on the beach at Tellicherry in Malabar. In the same district, a
friend once picked up on the shore at Cannanore a wooden figure about 6
inches high, riddled with nails. His wife&rsquo;s ayah implored him to
get rid of it, as it would bring nothing but misfortune. He accordingly
made a present of it to a recently married friend, whose subsequent
career was characterised by a long series of strokes of bad luck, which
his wife attributed entirely to the possession of the dreadful
image.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in Malabar, &ldquo;a mantram is written on the stem of
the kaitha plant, on which is also drawn a figure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>representing the person to be injured. A hole is
bored to represent the navel. The mantram is repeated, and at each
repetition a certain thorn (k&#257;ramullu) is stuck into the limbs of
the figure. The name of the person, and of the star under which he was
born, are written on a piece of cadjan, which is stuck into the navel.
The thorns are removed, and replaced twenty-one times. Two magic
circles are drawn below the nipples of the figure. The stem is then
hung up in the smoke of the kitchen. A pot of toddy, and some other
accessories, are procured, and with them the warlock performs certain
rites. He then moves three steps backwards, and shouts aloud thrice,
fixing in the thorns again, and thinking all the while of the
particular mischief with which he will afflict the person to be
injured. When all this has been done, the person whose figure has been
drawn on the stem, and pricked with thorns, feels pain.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>The following variant of the above rite has been described<a class=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A block of lead is moulded into the effigy of a
man about a span in length. The stomach is opened, and the name and
star of the intended victim are inscribed along with a charm on a lead
plate, and placed therein. The effigy is laid recumbent on a plantain
leaf, on which a little water mixed with sandal has first been
sprinkled, and the smoke of an extinguished wick is passed thrice over
it. Then nine little square pieces of plantain leaf (or leaves of
<i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>) are placed round the effigy, and in each
square some rice-flour, and chouflower petals. Beside the effigy are
shells holding toddy and arrack (liquor), a burning lamp, and several
little wicks. One of the wicks is lighted, and the flame passed thrice
over the collection. Nine wicks are lighted, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>and
put on the nine squares. The charm inscribed on the lead plate is at
this stage repeated fervently in an undertone no less than twenty-one
times. This preamble, or one closely resembling it, is generally the
beginning of the mantrav&#257;di&rsquo;s programme. The rest of it is
guided by the special circumstances of each case. Let us suppose that
the wizard, having a victim in view, wishes the latter to be afflicted
with burning pains and insufferable heat all over his body. The
following is the ceremony he would perform. Thinking of the victim, he
drives a thorn of <i>Canthium parviflorum</i> into the effigy, and
then, folding up the collection detailed above in the plantain leaf, he
proceeds to a tank or pool, and immerses himself up to the neck. He
places the bundle on the surface of the water&mdash;he tells you it
will float despite the lead&mdash;and, calling for a cock, cuts off its
head, permitting the blood and the head to fall on the bundle. He
presses the bundle down into the water, and submerges himself at the
same time. Coming to the surface, he goes ashore, whistling thrice, and
being very careful not to look behind him. Within twenty-one days, the
charm will take effect. In order to induce a boil or tumour to appear
in a victim&rsquo;s foot, the mantrav&#257;di inscribes a certain charm
on a sheet of lead, and stuffs the plate into a frog&rsquo;s mouth,
repeats another charm, and blows into the batrachian&rsquo;s mouth,
which is then stitched up, after which the creature is bound with
twenty-one coils of string. The frog is next set down on a plantain
leaf, the ritual already described with the squares, toddy, etc., is
performed, the frog is wrapped up together with the various substances
in the leaf, and buried at some spot where two or more roads meet, and
which the victim is likely to pass. Should he cross the fateful spot,
he will suddenly become conscious of a feeling in his foot, as though a
thorn had pricked him. From that moment dates the beginning of a week
of intense agony. His foot swells, fever sets in, he has pains all over
his body, and for seven days existence is intolerable. The cherukaladi
is another form of odi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href=
"#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>mantram, and the manner in which
it is performed is extremely interesting. The wizard takes three balls
of rice, blackens one, reddens another, and passes through the third a
young yetah fish (<i>Bagarius yarrellii</i>), after having put down its
throat seven green chillies, seven grains of raw rice, and as many of
pepper. In the carapace of a crab some toddy, and in the valve of a
particular kind of mussel, some arrack is placed. The sorcerer conveys
all these things to a hill built by termites (white-ants). The crown of
the hill is knocked off, and the substances are thrown in. Walking
round the mound thrice, the magician recites a charm, and comes away
without looking over his shoulder.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4217src"
href="#xd26e4217" name="xd26e4217src">27</a> Within a very short time,
similar effects are produced as those resulting from the previously
described form of sorcery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A gr&#257;ndha (palm-leaf book), describing how an enemy may be
struck down, gives the following details. The head of a fowl with
dark-coloured flesh is cut off. The head is then split open, and a
piece of cadjan (palm-leaf), on which are written the name of the
person to be injured, and the name of the star under which he was born,
is stuck in the split head, which is then sewn up and the tongue
stitched to the beak. The head is then inserted into a certain fruit,
which is tied up with a withe of a creeper, and deposited under the
enemy&rsquo;s gateway.</p>
<p>In Malabar, a wooden figure is sometimes made, and a tuft of a
woman&rsquo;s hair tied on its head. It is fixed to a tree, and nails
are driven into the neck and breast, to inflict hurt on an enemy.
Sometimes a live frog or lizard is buried within a cocoanut shell,
after nails have been stuck into its eyes and stomach. The deaths of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=

of the hair is nailed. She flings herself about in a frenzy, and throws

tree, and the woman recovers.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4237src" href=

<p class="first">&ldquo;There are many professional exorcists, who are

away. He answers through the mouth of the woman, who works herself up
into a frenzy, and throws herself about wildly. If he will not answer,
the woman is whipped with the rattan which the exorcist carries, or
with a bunch of margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) twigs. When he
replies, his requests for offerings of certain kinds are complied with.
When he is satisfied, and agrees to leave, a stone is placed on the
woman&rsquo;s head, and she is let go, and dashes off into darkness.
The place at which the stone drops to the ground is <span class=

<p>Sometimes a sorcerer makes an evil spirit take a vow that it will
not trouble any one in the future, and, in return, offers to it the
blood of fowls, a goat, etc. He then orders the spirit to climb a tree,
and drives three large iron nails into the trunk thereof. As iron is
disliked by evil spirits, the result is to confine the spirit in the
tree, for it cannot descend beyond the nails. In the Telugu country,
when a person is supposed to be possessed by a devil, it is often the
practice to take him to some special tree, which is believed to be a
favourite residence of demons, and drive a nail into the trunk. If the
devil has any proper feeling, he thereupon leaves the man or woman, and
takes up his abode in the tree. This ceremony is performed with certain
religious rites, and involves considerable expenditure. Sometimes,
devil drivers are called in, who &ldquo;seat the woman in a fog of
resin smoke, and work upon or beat her until she declares the supposed
desires of the devil in the way of sacrifice; and, when these have been
complied with, one of her hairs is put in a bottle, formally shown to
the village goddess, and buried in the jungle, while iron nails are
driven into the threshold of the woman&rsquo;s house to prevent the
devil&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4256src" href=

<p>At the first menstrual ceremonies of a Pulaya girl in the Cochin
State, she stands on the morning of the seventh day before some
Parayas, who play on their flute and drum, to cast out the demons, if
any, from her body. If she is possessed by them, she leaps with frantic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>movements. In this case, the demon is
transferred to a tree by driving a nail into the trunk, after offerings
have been made.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4263src" href="#xd26e4263"
name="xd26e4263src">33</a> When an Odd&#275; (Telugu navvy) girl
reaches puberty, she is confined in a special hut, in which a piece of
iron, and other things, are placed, to keep off evil spirits. In some
castes, when a woman is in labour, an iron sickle is kept on the cot
for a similar purpose. After delivery, she keeps iron in some form,
<i>e.g.</i>, a small crowbar, knife, or nails, in the room, and takes
it about with her when she goes out. At a N&#257;yar funeral in
Malabar, the chief mourner holds in his hand, or tucks into his
waist-cloth, a piece of iron, generally a long key.<a class="noteref"

article of iron which is at hand. A ceremony, called Dw&#257;ra
Pratishta, is performed by Ling&#257;yats when the door-frame of a new
house is set up, and an iron nail is driven into the frame, to prevent
devils or evil spirits from entering the house. A former R&#257;ja of
Vizianagram would not allow the employment of iron in the construction
of buildings in his territory, because it would inevitably be followed
by smallpox or other epidemic.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4275src"

<p>A few years ago, a Native servant was charged with beating with a
cane a woman who was suffering from malarial fever after her
confinement, in order to drive out a devil, which was said to be the
spirit of a woman who was drowned some time previously. The woman died
three days after the beating, and various abrasions were found on the
head and body. The sub-magistrate held <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>that the hurt was
part of the ceremony, to which the husband and mother of the woman, and
the woman herself, gave their consent. But, as the hurt was needlessly
severe, the servant was fined twenty-five rupees, or in default five
weeks&rsquo; rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>The practice of extracting or knocking out some of the teeth of a
magician is widespread throughout Southern India. In connection
therewith Mr R. Morris writes to me as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A sorcerer&rsquo;s spells depend for their
efficacy upon the distinctness with which they are pronounced. The
words uttered by a man, some or all of whose front teeth are damaged,
are not so clear and distinct as those of a man whose teeth are intact.
Consequently, if a sorcerer&rsquo;s front teeth are smashed, he is
ruined as a sorcerer. And, if the front teeth of his corpse are broken
or extracted, his ghost is prevented from bewitching people. It is
necessary to mutilate a corpse, in order to prevent the ghost doing
what the live man unmutilated could have done. For example, when a man
is murdered, he is hamstrung, to prevent the ghost from following in
pursuit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In connection with sorcery among the Oriyas, Mr S. P. Rice tells
us<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4290src" href="#xd26e4290" name=
"xd26e4290src">36</a> that a girl was suffering from mental disease,
and believed to be possessed by a devil. She declared that she was
bewitched by a certain man, who had to be cured of his power over her.
Accordingly, the friends and relatives of the girl went to this
man&rsquo;s house, dragged him out into the road, laid him on his back,
and sat on his chest. They then proceeded to extract two of his front
teeth with a hammer and pincers. Mr Rice adds that it does not appear
how the cure was to work&mdash;whether the operators thought that words
of cursing or magic, coming through the orifice of the teeth,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>would be mumbled, and thus lose some of their
incisive force, and therefore of their power for evil, or whether it
was thought that the devil wanted room to fly out. Attacks upon
supposed sorcerers are said to be not uncommon in the Jeypore Agency.
In one instance, a wizard&rsquo;s front teeth were pulled out by the
local blacksmith, to render him unable to pronounce his spells with the
distinctness requisite to real efficiency.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4295src" href="#xd26e4295" name="xd26e4295src">37</a> In the
Vizagapatam district, where a village was supposed to contain a witch,
a D&#257;sari (religious mendicant) was called upon to examine his
books, and name the person. He fixed on some wretched woman, whose
front teeth were knocked out, and her mouth filled with filth. She was
then beaten with a switch made from the castor-oil plant. A few years
ago, a woman in the North Arcot district was suffering from severe pain
in the abdomen, and she and her husband were made to believe that she
was possessed by a devil, which a Bair&#257;gi (religious mendicant)
offered to expel. His treatment went on for some days, and the final
operations were conducted by the side of a pond. The Bair&#257;gi
repeated mantrams, while the woman was seated opposite him. Suddenly
she grew violently excited, and possessed by the deity Muniswara. She
pulled the Bair&#257;gi backwards by his hair, and cried out,
&ldquo;Break his teeth.&rdquo; She then opened his mouth by pulling up
the upper lip, and her husband took a small stone, and broke some of
the incisor teeth. The woman continued to cry out, &ldquo;He is
chanting mantrams; pour water into his mouth, and stop his
breathing.&rdquo; A third party brought water, and the woman&rsquo;s
husband poured it into the Bair&#257;gi&rsquo;s mouth. A struggle
ensued, and the woman called out, &ldquo;I am losing my life; he is
chanting; the mantram is in his throat; he is binding me by his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>spell; put a stick into his throat.&rdquo; The
third party then brought the Bair&#257;gi&rsquo;s curved stick
(y&#333;gathandam), which the husband thrust into the
Bair&#257;gi&rsquo;s mouth, with the result that he died. The woman was
sent to a lunatic asylum, and her husband, as there was no previous
intention to cause death, and he was evidently under the influence of
blind superstition, received only four and a half months&rsquo;
imprisonment. In a further case which occurred in the North Arcot
district, a man was believed to have great power over animals, of which
he openly boasted, threatening to destroy all the cattle of one of his
neighbours. This man and his friends believed that they could deprive
the sorcerer of his power for evil by drawing all his teeth, which they
proceeded to do with fatal results. In the Kistna district, a M&#257;la
weaver was suspected of practising sorcery by destroying men with
devils, and bringing cholera and other diseases. He was met by certain
villagers, and asked for tobacco. While he stopped to get the tobacco
out, he was seized and thrown on the ground. His hands were tied behind
his back, and his legs bound fast with his waist-cloth. One man sat on
his legs, another on his waist, and a third held his head down by the
kudumi (hair-knot). His mouth was forced open with a pair of large
pincers, and a piece of stick was thrust between the teeth to prevent
the mouth closing. One of the assistants got a stone as big as a
man&rsquo;s fist, and with it struck the sorcerer&rsquo;s upper and
lower teeth several times until they were loosened. Then nine teeth
were pulled out with the pincers. A quantity of milk-hedge
(<i>Euphorbia</i>) juice was poured on the bleeding gums, and the
unfortunate man was left lying on his back, to free himself from his
bonds as best he could.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4304src" href=
"#xd26e4304" name="xd26e4304src">38</a> In the Tamil country, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>Vekkil Tottiyans are supposed to be able to
control certain evil spirits, and cause them to possess a man. It is
believed, however, that they are deprived of their power as soon as
they lose one of their teeth.</p>
<p>The Kondhs of Ganjam believe that they can transform themselves into
tigers or snakes, half the soul leaving the body and becoming changed
into one of these animals, either to kill an enemy, or to satisfy
hunger by having a good feed on cattle. During this period they are
said to feel dull and listless, and, if a tiger is killed in the
forest, they will die at the same time. Mr Fawcett informs me that the
Kondhs believe that the soul wanders during sleep. On one occasion, a
dispute arose owing to a man discovering that another Kondh, whose
spirit used to wander about in the guise of a tiger, ate up his soul,
and he fell ill. Like the Kondhs, some Paniyans of Malabar are believed
to be gifted with the power of changing themselves into animals. There
is a belief that, if they wish to secure a woman whom they lust after,
one of the men gifted with the special power goes to the house at night
with a hollow bamboo, and goes round it three times. The woman then
comes out, and the man, changing himself into a bull or dog, works his
wicked will. The woman is said to die in the course of a few days. For
assuming the disguise of an animal, the following formul&aelig; are
said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4311src" href="#xd26e4311" name=
"xd26e4311src">39</a> to be effective:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Take the head of a dog and burn it, and plant on it a vellakuthi
plant. Burn camphor and frankincense, and adore it. Then pluck the
root, mix it with the milk of a dog, and the bones of a cat. A mark
made with the mixture on the forehead will enable a person to assume
the form of any animal he thinks of. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. Worship with a lighted wick and incense before a stick of the
malankara plant. Then chant the Sakti mantram one hundred and one
times. Watch carefully which way the stick inclines. Proceed to the
south of the stick, and pluck the whiskers of a live tiger. Make with
them a ball of the veerali silk, string it with silk, and enclose it
within the ear. Stand on the palms of the hand to attain the disguise
of a tiger, and, with the stick in hand, think of a cat, white bull, or
any other animal. Then you will appear as such in the eyes of
others.</p>
<p>The name Chedipe (prostitute) is applied to sorceresses in the
God&#257;vari district. The Chedipe is believed to ride on a tiger at
night over the boundaries of seven villages, and return home at early
morn. When she does not like a man, she goes to him bare-bodied at dead
of night, the closed doors of the house in which he is sleeping opening
before her. She sucks his blood by putting his toe in her mouth. He
will then lie like a corpse. Next morning he feels uneasy and
intoxicated, as if he had taken ganja, and remains in this condition
all day. If he does not take medicine from some one skilled in the
treatment of such cases, it is said that he will die. If he is properly
treated, he will recover in about ten days. If he makes no effort to
get cured, the Chedipe will molest him again, and, becoming gradually
emaciated, he will die. When a Chedipe enters a house, all those who
are awake will become insensible, those who are seated falling down as
if they had taken a soporific drug. Sometimes she drags out the tongue
of the intended victim, who will die at once. At other times, slight
abrasions will be found on the skin of the victim, and, when the
Chedipe puts pieces of stick thereon, they burn as if burnt by fire.
Sometimes she will find him behind a bush, and, undressing there, will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>fall on any passer-by in the jungle, assuming
the form of a tiger with one of the legs in human form. When thus
disguised, she is called Marulupuli (enchanting tiger). If the man is a
brave fellow, and tries to kill the Chedipe with any instrument he may
have with him, she will run away; and, if any man belonging to her
village detects her mischief, she will assume her real form, and say
blandly that she is only digging roots. The above story was obtained by
a Native official when he visited a Koyi village, where he was told
that a man had been sentenced to several years&rsquo; imprisonment for
being one of a gang who had murdered a Chedipe for being a
sorceress.</p>
<p>In the Vizagapatam district, the people believe that a witch, when
she wishes to revenge herself on any man, climbs at night to the top of
his house, and, making a hole through the roof, drops a thread down
till the end of it touches the body of the sleeping man. Then she sucks
at the other end, and draws up all the blood out of his body. Witches
are said to be able to remove all the bones out of a man&rsquo;s body,
or to deposit a fish, ball of hair, or rags in his stomach. The town of
Jeypore was once said to be haunted by a ghost. It was described as a
woman, who paraded the town at midnight in a state of nudity, and from
her mouth proceeded flames of fire. She sucked the blood of any loose
cattle she found about, and, in the same way, revenged herself on any
man who had insulted her.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4326src" href=

<p>I am informed by Mr G. F. Paddison that, in cases of sickness among
the Savaras of Vizagapatam, a buffalo is tied up near the door of the
house. Herbs and rice in small platters, and a little brass vessel
containing toddy, balls of rice, flowers, and medicine, are brought
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>with a bow and arrow. The arrow is thicker at
the basal end than towards the tip. The narrow part goes, when shot,
through a hole in front of the bow, which is too small to allow of the
passage of the rest of the arrow. A B&#275;ju (wise woman) pours some
toddy over the herbs and rice, and daubs the patient over the forehead,
breasts, stomach, and back. She croons out a long incantation to the
goddess, stopping at intervals to call out &ldquo;Daru,&rdquo; to
attract the attention of the goddess. She then takes the bow and arrow,
and shoots twice into the air, and, standing behind the kneeling
patient, shoots balls of medicine stuck on the tip of the arrow at her.
The construction of the arrow is such that the balls are dislodged from
its tip. The patient is thus shot at all over the body, which is
bruised by the impact of the medicine balls. Afterwards the B&#275;ju
shoots one or two balls at the buffalo, which is taken to a path
forming the village boundary, and killed with a tangi (axe). The
patient is then daubed with the blood of the buffalo, rice, and toddy,
and a feast concludes the ceremonial. Mr Paddison once gave some
medicine to the Porojas of Vizagapatam during an epidemic of cholera in
a village. They took it eagerly, but, as he was going away, asked
whether it would not be a quicker cure to put the witch in the next
village, who had brought on the cholera, into jail. In the Koraput
t&#257;luk of Vizagapatam, a wizard once had a reputation for
possessing the power of transplanting trees, and it was believed that,
if a man displeased him, his trees were moved in the night, and planted
in some one else&rsquo;s grounds.</p>
<p>It is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4335src" href="#xd26e4335"
name="xd26e4335src">41</a> by the Rev. J. Cain that the Koyis of the
God&#257;vari district &ldquo;assert that the death of every one is
caused by the machinations of a sorcerer, instigated thereto
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>by an enemy of the deceased, or of the
deceased&rsquo;s friends. So, in former years, inquiry was always made
as to the person likely to have been at such enmity with the deceased
as to wish for his death; and, having settled upon a suspicious
individual, the friends of the deceased used to carry the corpse to the
accused, and call upon him to clear himself by undergoing the ordeal of
dipping his hands in boiling oil or water.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4340src" href="#xd26e4340" name="xd26e4340src">42</a> Within the
last two years, I have known of people running away from their village
because of their having been accused of having procured by means of a
wizard the death of some one with whom they were at enmity about a plot
of land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to another account,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4348src"
href="#xd26e4348" name="xd26e4348src">43</a> &ldquo;some male member of
the family of the deceased throws coloured rice over the corpse as it
lies on the bed, pronouncing as he does so the names of all the known
sorcerers who live in the neighbourhood. It is even now solemnly
asserted that, when the name of the wizard responsible for the death is
pronounced, the bed gets up, and moves towards the house or village
where he resides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Cain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4353src" href=
"#xd26e4353" name="xd26e4353src">44</a> once saw a magician at work in
the God&#257;vari district, &ldquo;discovering the cause of the
sickness which had laid prostrate a strong Koyi man. He had in his hand
a leaf from an old palmyra leaf book, and, as he walked round and round
the patient, he pretended to be reading. Then he took up a small stick,
and drew a number of lines on the ground, after which he danced and
sang round and round the sick man, who sat looking at him, evidently
much impressed with his performance<span class="corr" id="xd26e4358"
title="Source: ,">.</span> Suddenly he made a dart at the man, and,
stooping down, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>bit him severely in two or three places in the
back. Then, rushing to the front, he produced a few grains, which he
said he had found in the man&rsquo;s back, and which were evidently the
cause of the sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another case, a young Koyi was employed to teach a few children
in his village, but ere long he was attacked by a strange disease,
which no medicine could cure. As a last resource, a magician was called
in, who declared the illness to have been brought on by a demoness at
the instigation of some enemy, who was envious of the money which the
lad had received for teaching. The magician produced a little silver,
which he declared to be a sure sign that the sickness was connected
with the silver money he was receiving for teaching.</p>
<p>A riot took place, in 1900, at the village of Korravanivasala in the
Vizagapatam district, under the following strange circumstances. A
Konda Dora (hill cultivator caste) named Korra Mallayya pretended that
he was inspired, and gradually gathered round him a camp of four or
five thousand people from various places. At first his proceedings were
harmless enough, but at last he gave out that he was a reincarnation of
one of the five P&#257;ndava brothers, the heroes of the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, who are worshipped by the Konda Doras.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4367src" href="#xd26e4367" name=
"xd26e4367src">45</a> He further announced that his infant son was the
god Krishna; that he would drive out the English, and rule the country
himself; and that, to effect this, he would arm his followers with
bamboos, which would be turned by magic into guns, and would change the
weapons of the authorities into water. Bamboos were cut, and rudely
fashioned to resemble guns, and, armed with these, the camp was drilled
by the Sw&#257;mi (god), as Mallayya had come to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>be
called. The assembly next sent word that they were going to loot
P&#257;chipenta, and, when two constables came to see how matters
stood, the fanatics fell upon them, and beat them to death. The local
police endeavoured to recover the bodies, but, owing to the threatening
attitude of the Sw&#257;mi&rsquo;s followers, had to abandon the
attempt. The district magistrate then went to the place in person,
collected reserve police from various places, and rushed the camp to
arrest the Sw&#257;mi and the other leaders of the movement. The police
were resisted by the mob, and obliged to fire. Eleven of the rioters
were killed, others wounded or arrested, and the rest dispersed. Sixty
of them were tried for rioting, and three, including the Sw&#257;mi,
for murdering the constables. Of the latter, the Sw&#257;mi died in
jail, and the other two were hanged. The Sw&#257;mi&rsquo;s son, the
god Krishna, also died, and all trouble ended.</p>
<p>A K&#257;pu (Telugu cultivator) in the Cuddapah district once
pretended to have received certain maxims direct from the Supreme
Being, and forewarned his neighbours that he would fall into a trance,
which actually occurred, and lasted for three days. On his recovery, he
stated that his spirit had been during this time in heaven, learning
the principles of the Advaita religion from a company of angels. One of
his peculiarities was that he went about naked, because, when once
engaged in separating two bullocks which were fighting, his cloth
tumbled down, after which he never put it on again. This eccentric
person is said to have pulled a handful of maggots from the body of a
dead dog, to have put them into his mouth, and to have spat them out
again as grains of rice. A shrine was built over his grave.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4374src" href="#xd26e4374" name=

<p>A few years ago, a Muhammadan fakir undertook to drive away the
plague in Bellary. Incantations were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>performed over a
black goat, which was sacrificed at a spot where several roads met. A
considerable sum of money was collected, and the poor were fed. But the
plague was not stayed.</p>
<p>On one occasion, an old woman hearing that her only son was
dangerously ill, sought the aid of a magician, who proceeded to utter
mantrams, to counteract the evil influences which were at work. While
this was being done, an accomplice of the magician turned up, and,
declaring that he was a policeman, threatened to charge the two with
sorcery if they did not pay him a certain sum of money. The woman paid
up, but discovered later on that she had been hoaxed.</p>
<p>Two men were, some years ago, sentenced to rigorous imprisonment
under the following circumstances. A lady, who was suffering from
illness, asked a man who claimed to be a magician to cure her. He came
with his confederate, and told the patient to place nine sovereigns on
a clay image. This sum not being forthcoming, a few rupees and a piece
of a gold necklace were accepted. These were deposited on the image,
and it was placed in a tin box, which was locked up, one of the men
retaining the key. On the following day the two men returned, and the
rupees and piece of gold were placed on a fresh image. Becoming
inspired by the god, one of the men announced that the patient must
give a gold bangle off her wrist, if she wished to be cured quickly.
The bangle was given up, and placed on the image, which was then
converted into a ball containing the various articles within it. The
patient was then directed to look at various corners of the room, and
repeat a formula. The image was placed in a box, and locked up as
before, and the men retired, promising to return next day. This they
failed to do, and the lady, becoming suspicious, broke <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>open
the box, in which the image was found, but the money and ornaments were
missing.</p>
<p>A case relating to the supposed guarding of treasure by an evil
spirit came before the Court in the Coimbatore district in 1908. Two
Valluvans (Tamil astrologers) were staying in a village, where they
were foretelling events. They went to the house of an old woman, and,
while telling her fortune, announced that there was a devil in the
house guarding treasure, and promised to drive it out, if twenty rupees
were given to them. The woman borrowed the money, and presented it to
them. In the evening the Valluvans went into the kitchen, and shut the
door. Certain ceremonies are said to have been performed, at the
conclusion of which the woman and her son entered the room, and, in the
light of a flickering torch, were shown a pit, in which there was a
copper pot, apparently full of gold sovereigns. One of the astrologers
feigned a sudden attack from the devil, and fell down as if
unconscious. The other pushed the people of the house outside the door,
and again shut it. Eventually the men came out, and announced that the
devil was a ferocious one, and would not depart till a wick from an
Erode parad&#275;si was lighted before it, for obtaining which a
hundred rupees were required. If the devil was not thus propitiated, it
would, they said, kill the people of the house sooner or later. The old
woman borrowed the sum required, and her son and the two astrologers
went to Karur to take the train to Erode, to meet the parad&#275;si. At
Karur the two men took tickets for different places, and the son,
becoming suspicious, informed the police, who arrested them. On them
were found some circular pieces of card covered with gold tinsel.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a Zamindar (landowner) in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>God&#257;vari district engaged a Muhammadan to
exorcise a devil which haunted his house. The latter, explaining that
the devil was a female and fond of jewelry, induced the Zamindar to
leave a large quantity of jewels in a locked receptacle in a certain
room, to which only the exorcist, and of course the devil, had access.
The latter, it was supposed, would be gratified by the loan of the
jewels, and would cease from troubling. The exorcist managed to open
the receptacle and steal the jewels, and, such was the faith of his
employer, that the offence was not suspected until a police inspector
seized Rs. 27,000 worth of jewels in Vizagapatam on suspicion, and they
were with difficulty traced to their source.</p>
<p>In a note on wonder-working in India, the Rev. J. Sharrock narrates
the following incident.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A Sany&#257;si (ascetic) was ordered with
contempt from the house of a rich Zemindar. Thereupon, the former
threatened to curse his house by despatching a devil to take possession
of it that very night. On one of the doors of the inner courtyard he
made a number of magical passes, and then left the house in high
dudgeon. As soon as it grew dark, the devil appeared on the door in
flickering flames of phosphorus, and almost frightened the Zemindar and
the other inmates out of their five senses. Wild with terror, they fled
to the Sany&#257;si, and begged and entreated him to come and exorcise
the devil. Of course he refused, and of course they pressed him with
greater and greater presents till he was satisfied. Then he came with
kungkuma (a mixture of turmeric, alum, and lime-juice), and rubbed the
fiery demon off with the usual recitation of mantras. During the rest
of his stay, the Sany&#257;si was treated with the most profound
respect, while his sishyas (disciples) received the choicest food and
fruits that could be obtained.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following cases are called from the annual reports of the
Chemical Examiner to the Government of Madras, in further illustration
of the practices of pseudo-magicians.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) A wizard came to a village, in order to exorcise a devil
which possessed a certain woman. He was treated like a prince, and was
given the only room in the house, while the family turned out into the
hall. He lived there for several days, and then commenced his
ceremonies. He drew the figure of a lotus on the floor, made the woman
sit down, and commenced to twist her hair with his wand. When she cried
out, he sent her out of the room, saying she was unworthy to sit on the
lotus figure, but promising nevertheless to exorcise the devil without
her being present. He found a half-witted man in the village, drugged
him with ganja, brought him to the house, and performed his ceremonies
on this man, who, on becoming intoxicated with the drug, began to get
boisterous. The wizard tied him up with a rope, because he had become
possessed of the devil that had possessed the woman. The man was
subsequently traced by his relatives, found in an unconscious state,
and taken to hospital. The wizard got rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Some jewels were lost, and a mantrak&#257;ra (dealer in
magical spells) was called in to detect the thief. The magician erected
a screen, behind which he lit a lamp, and did other things to impress
the crowd with the importance of his mantrams. To the assembly he
distributed betel-leaf patties containing a white powder, said to be
holy ashes, and the effect of it on the suspected individuals, who
formed part of the crowd, is said to have been instantaneous. So
magical was the effect of this powder in detecting the thief, that the
unfortunate man ultimately vomited blood. When the people remonstrated
with the magician for the severity of his magic, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>administered to the sufferer an antidote of
solution of cow-dung and the juice of some leaf. The holy ashes were
found to contain corrosive sublimate, and the magician got eighteen
months&rsquo; rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>I may conclude with a reference to an interesting note on the
Jesuits of the Madura Mission in the middle of the seventeenth century
by the Rev. J. S. Chandler, who writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Dr Nobili lodged in an incommodious hut, and
celebrated mass in another hut. The older he got, the more he added to
the austerity of his life. The Pand&#257;rams<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4420src" href="#xd26e4420" name="xd26e4420src">47</a>
(non-Br&#257;hman priests) made a new attempt against his life. One
fine day they held a council as to the death he should die, and decided
on magic. They summoned the most famous magician of the kingdom. Every
one knew of it. When the day came, the magician presented himself,
followed by a crowd, all alert to witness the vengeance of their gods.
He insolently arranged his machines, and then described circles in the
air. Dr Nobili regarded him with a composed air. Soon the ceremonies
became more noisy. The features of the magician became decomposed, his
eyes inflamed, his face contracted like that of one possessed; he
ground his teeth, howled, and struck the ground with his feet, hands,
and forehead. Dr Nobili asked what comedy he was pretending to play.
Then he recited magical sentences. Dr Nobili begged him to spare his
throat. The magician said &lsquo;You have laughed, now die,&rsquo; and
threw a black powder into the air, at the same time looking at his
victim, to see him fall at his feet, and then &hellip; skedaddled from
the jeers of the crowd. Dr Nobili addressed the crowd, and from that
time they regarded him as more than human.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Chandler narrates further that<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4426src" href="#xd26e4426" name="xd26e4426src">48</a> &ldquo;a
J&#333;gi (sorcerer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272"
name="pb272">272</a>]</span>and exorcist) lost in public opinion by
pretending to perform a miracle in imitation of a previous J&#333;gi,
by making a stone bull eat. A quantity of rice and other grains was
served to the figure, but the vah&#257;nam (vehicle) of Rudra was not
hungry. The J&#333;gi made many grimaces, threatened, and even employed
a rattan cane, but the bull remained motionless. Not so the spectators,
who overwhelmed the J&#333;gi with blows, and he was only saved by his
friends, conducted to the frontier by soldiers, and forbidden ever
again to enter the kingdom.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273"

<p class="first">It has been said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4439src"
href="#xd26e4439" name="xd26e4439src">1</a> that &ldquo;men not only
attempt to act directly upon nature, but they usually exhibit a keen
desire to be guided as to the best course to take when in doubt,
difficulty, or danger, and to be forewarned of the future. The practice
of divination is by no means confined to professional magicians, or
even to soothsayers, but any one may employ the accessory
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of professional diviners in Southern India, perhaps the best example
is afforded by the Kaniyans<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4444src" href=
"#xd26e4444" name="xd26e4444src">2</a> or Kanisans of Malabar, whose
caste name is said to be a Malay&#257;lam corruption of the Sanskrit
Ganika, meaning astrologer. Duarte Barbosa,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4447src" href="#xd26e4447" name="xd26e4447src">3</a> at the
beginning of the sixteenth century, has a detailed reference to the
Kaniyans, of whom he writes that &ldquo;they learn letters and
astronomy, and some of them are great astrologers, and foretell many
future things, and form judgements upon the births of men. Kings and
great persons send to call them, and come out of their palaces to
gardens and pleasure-houses to see <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>them, and ask them what they
desire to know; and these people form judgement upon these things in a
few days, and return to those that asked them, but they may not enter
the palaces; nor may they approach the king&rsquo;s person on account
of being low people. And the king is then alone with him. They are
great diviners, and pay great attention to times and places of good and
bad luck, which they cause to be observed by those kings and great men,
and by the merchants also; and they take care to do their business at
the time which these astrologers advise them, and they do the same in
their voyages and marriages. And by these means these men gain a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buchanan,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4454src" href="#xd26e4454"
name="xd26e4454src">4</a> three centuries later, notes that the
Kaniyans &ldquo;possess almanacks, by which they inform people as to
the proper time for performing ceremonies or sowing their seeds, and
the hours which are fortunate or unfortunate for any undertaking. When
persons are sick or in trouble, the Cunishun, by performing certain
ceremonies in a magical square of 12 places, discovers what spirit is
the cause of the evil, and also how it may be appeased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kaniyans are practically the guiding spirits in all the social
and domestic concerns in Malabar, and even Christians and Muhammadans
resort to them for advice. From the moment of the birth of an infant,
which is noted by the Kaniyan for the purpose of casting its horoscope,
to the moment of death, the services of the village astrologer are
constantly in requisition. He is consulted as to the cause of all
calamities, and the cautious answers that he gives satisfy the people.
&ldquo;Putro na putri,&rdquo; which may either mean no son but a
daughter, or no daughter but a son, is referred to as the type of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>a Kaniyan&rsquo;s answer, when questioned about
the sex of an unborn child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It would be difficult,&rdquo; Mr Logan
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4464src" href="#xd26e4464" name=
"xd26e4464src">5</a> &ldquo;to describe a single important occasion in
everyday life when the Kanisan is not at hand, foretelling lucky days
and hours, casting horoscopes, explaining the cause of calamities,
prescribing remedies for untoward events, and physicians (not physic)
for sick persons. Seed cannot be sown, or trees planted, unless the
Kanisan has been consulted beforehand. He is even asked to consult his
shastras to find lucky days and moments for setting out on a journey,
commencing an enterprise, giving a loan, executing a deed, or shaving
the head. For such important occasions as births, marriages, tonsure,
investiture with the sacred thread, and beginning the A, B, C, the
Kanisan is, of course, indispensable. His work, in short, mixes him up
with the gravest as well as the most trivial of the domestic events of
the people, and his influence and position are correspondingly great.
The astrologer&rsquo;s finding, as one will assert with all due
reverence, is the oracle of God himself, with the justice of which
every one ought to be satisfied, and the poorer classes follow his
dictates unhesitatingly. The astrologer&rsquo;s most busy time is from
January to July, the period of harvest and marriages, but in the other
six months of the year he is far from leading an idle life. His most
lucrative business lies in casting horoscopes, recording the events of
a man&rsquo;s life from birth to death, pointing out dangerous periods
of life, and prescribing rules and ceremonies to be observed by
individuals for the purpose of propitiating the gods and planets, and
so averting the calamities of dangerous times. He also shows favourable
junctures for the commencement of undertakings, and the grantham or
book, written on palm leaf, sets forth in considerable detail the
person&rsquo;s disposition and mental qualities, as affected by the
position of the planets in the zodiac at the moment of birth. All this
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>a work of labour, and of time. There are few
members of respectable families who are not thus provided, and nobody
grudges the five to twenty-five rupees usually paid for a horoscope,
according to the position and reputation of the astrologer. Two things
are essential to the astrologer, namely, a bag of cowry shells
(<i>Cypr&aelig;a moneta</i>), and an almanac. When any one comes to
consult him,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4472src" href="#xd26e4472"
name="xd26e4472src">6</a> he quietly sits down, facing the sun, on a
plank seat or mat, murmuring some mantrams or sacred verses, opens his
bag of cowries, and pours them on the floor. With his right hand he
moves them slowly round and round, solemnly reciting meanwhile a stanza
or two in praise of his guru or teacher, and of his deity, invoking
their help. He then stops, and explains what he has been doing, at the
same time taking a handful of cowries from the heap, and placing them
on one side. In front is a diagram drawn with chalk (or soapstone) on
the floor, and consisting of twelve compartments (r&#257;sis), one for
each month in the year. Before commencing operations with the diagram,
he selects three or five of the cowries highest up in the heap, and
places them in a line on the right-hand side. [In an account before me,
three cowries and two glass bottle-stoppers are mentioned as being
placed on this side]. These represent Ganapati (the belly god, the
remover of difficulties), the sun, the planet Jupiter, Sarasvati (the
goddess of speech), and his own guru or preceptor. To all of these the
astrologer gives due obeisance, touching his ears and the ground three
times with both hands. The cowries are next arranged in the
compartments of the diagram, and are moved about from compartment to
compartment by the astrologer, who quotes meanwhile the authority on
which he makes the moves. Finally he explains the result, and ends with
again worshipping the deified cowries, who were witnessing the
operation as spectators.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=

<p>According to another account,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4479src"
href="#xd26e4479" name="xd26e4479src">7</a> the Kaniyan &ldquo;pours
his cowries on the ground, and, after rolling them in the palm of his
right hand, while repeating mantrams, he selects the largest, and
places them in a row outside the diagram at its right-hand top corner.
They represent the first seven planets, and he does obeisance to them,
touching his forehead and the ground three times with both hands. The
relative position of the nine planets is then worked out, and
illustrated with cowries in the diagram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mulla Kurumbas (jungle tribe) of Malabar are said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4484src" href="#xd26e4484" name="xd26e4484src">8</a>
to &ldquo;have a gift of prophecy, some being initiated in the art
known as Kotiveykal, literally planting betel vine. The professor, when
consulted about any future event, husks a small quantity of rice by
hand, places it inside a scooped shell of a dried kuvvalam fruit
(<i>&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>), and asks one of his men to plant the
betel vine. The man understands the meaning, takes out the rice, and
spreads it on a plank. The professor invokes the Puthadi deity, makes a
calculation, and gives his reply, which is generally found
correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning a class of people called Velichchap&#257;d, who are
regarded as oracles in Malabar, Mr F. Fawcett writes as
follows<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4492src" href="#xd26e4492" name=
"xd26e4492src">9</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Far away in rural Malabar, I witnessed the
ceremony in which the Velichchap&#257;d exhibited his quality. It was
in the neighbourhood of a N&#257;yar house, to which thronged all the
neighbours (N&#257;yar), men and women, boys and girls. The ceremony
lasts about an hour. The N&#257;yar said it was the custom in his
family to have it done once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>a year, but could give no account
of how it originated; most probably in a vow, some ancestor having
vowed that, if such or such benefit be received, he would for ever
after have an annual performance of this ceremony in his house. It
involved some expenditure, as the Velichchap&#257;d had to be paid, and
the neighbours had to be fed. Somewhere about the middle of the little
courtyard, the Velichchap&#257;d placed a lamp (of the Malabar pattern)
having a lighted wick, a kalasam (brass vessel), some flowers, camphor,
saffron (turmeric), and other paraphernalia. Bhagavati was the deity
invoked, and the business involved offering flowers, and waving a
lighted wick round the kalasam. The Velichchap&#257;d&rsquo;s movements
became quicker, and, suddenly seizing his sword, he ran round the
courtyard (against the sun, as sailors say), shouting wildly. He is
under the influence of the deity who has been introduced into him, and
gives oracular utterances to the deity&rsquo;s commands. What he said I
know not, and no one else seemed to know, or care in the least, much
interested though they were in the performance. As he ran, every now
and then he cut his forehead with the sword, pressing it against the
skin and sawing vertically up and down. The blood streamed all over his
face. Presently he became wilder, and whizzed round the lamp, bending
forward towards the kalasam. Evidently some deity, some spirit was
present here, and spoke through the mouth of the Velichchap&#257;d.
This, I think, undoubtedly represents the belief of all who were
present. When he had done whizzing round the kalasam, he soon became a
normal being, and stood before my camera. The fee for the
self-inflicted laceration is one rupee, some rice, etc. I saw the
Velichchap&#257;d about three days afterwards, going to perform
elsewhere. The wound on his forehead had healed. The careful observer
can always identify a Velichchap&#257;d by the triangular patch over
the forehead, where the hair will not grow, and where the skin is
somewhat indurated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kotas of the Nilgiris worship M&#257;g&#257;li, to whose
influence outbreaks of cholera are attributed. When the dread disease
breaks out among them, special sacrifices are performed with a view to
propitiating the goddess, who is represented by an upright stone in a
rude temple near Kotagiri. An annual ceremony takes place there, at
which some man becomes possessed, and announces to the people that
M&#257;g&#257;li has come. At the seed-sowing ceremony, a Kota priest
sometimes becomes inspired, and gives expression to oracular
utterances. At a Toda funeral, the men, congregating on the summit of a
neighbouring hill, invoked the gods. Four of them, seized, apparently
in imitation of the Kota d&#275;v&#257;di (priest), with divine frenzy,
began to shiver and gesticulate wildly while running to and fro with
closed eyes. They then began to talk in Malay&#257;lam, and offer an
explanation of an extraordinary phenomenon, which had appeared in the
form of a gigantic figure, which disappeared as suddenly as it
appeared. The possession by some Todas of a smattering of
Malay&#257;lam is explained by the fact that, when grazing their
buffaloes on the western slopes of the N&#299;lgiris, they come in
contact with Malay&#257;lam-speaking people from the neighbouring
Malabar country.</p>
<p>For the following note on the Sakuna Pakshi (prophetic bird)
mendicant caste, I am indebted to Mr C. Hayavadana Rao. The name of the
caste is due to the fact that the members thereof wear on their heads a
plume composed of the feathers of the Indian roller (<i>Coracias
indica</i>) or blue jay of Europeans. This is one of the birds called
sakuna pakshi, because they are supposed to possess the power of
foretelling events, and on their movements many omens depend.
Concerning the roller, Jerdon writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4511src" href="#xd26e4511" name="xd26e4511src">10</a> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;it is sacred to Siva, who assumed its form,
and, at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>the feast of the Dasserah at Nagpore, one or
more used to be liberated by the R&#257;jah, amidst the firing of
cannon and musketry, at a grand parade attended by all the officers of
the station. Buchanan Hamilton also states that, before the Durga Puja,
the Hindus of Calcutta purchase one of these birds, and, at the time
when they throw the image of Durga into the river, set it at liberty.
It is considered propitious to see it on this day, and those who cannot
afford to buy one discharge their matchlocks to put it on the
wing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Sakuna Pakshi, before starting on a begging expedition, rises
early, and has a cold meal. He then puts on the Vaishnava n&#257;mam
mark on his forehead, slings on his left shoulder a deer-skin pouch for
the reception of the rice and other grain which will be given to him as
alms, and takes up his little drum (gilaka or damaraka) made of
frog&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>Closely allied to the Sakuna Pakshis are the Budubudik&#275;s or
Budubudukalas, a class of beggars and fortune-tellers, whose name is
derived from the drum (budbuki) which they use when engaged in
predicting future events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A huge parti-coloured turban, surmounted by a
bunch of feathers, a pair of ragged trousers, a loose long coat, which
is very often out at elbows, and a capacious wallet, ordinarily
constitute the Budubudukala&rsquo;s dress. Occasionally, if he can
afford it, he indulges in the luxury of a tiger or cheetah (leopard)
skin, which hangs down his back, and contributes to the dignity of his
calling. Add to this an odd assortment of clothes suspended on his left
arm, and the picture is as grotesque as it can be. He is regarded as
able to predict the future of human beings by the flight and notes of
birds. His predictions are couched in the chant which he recites. The
burden of the chant is always stereotyped, and purports to have been
gleaned from the warble of the feathered songsters of the forest. It
prognosticates peace, plenty and prosperity to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>the
house, the birth of a son to the fair, lotus-eyed housewife, and
worldly advancement to the master, whose virtues are as countless as
the stars, and have the power to annihilate his enemies. It also holds
out a tempting prospect of coming joy in an unknown shape from an
unknown quarter, and concludes with an appeal for a cloth. If the
appeal is successful, well and good. If not, the Budubudukala has the
patience and perseverance to repeat his visit the next day, and so on
until, in sheer disgust, the householder parts with a cloth. The drum,
which has been referred to as giving the Budubudukala his name, is not
devoid of interest. In appearance it is an instrument of diminutive
size, and is shaped like an hour-glass, to the middle of which is
attached a string with a knot at the end, which serves as the
percutient. Its origin is enveloped in a myth of which the Budubudukala
is very proud, for it tells of his divine descent, and invests his
vocation with the halo of sanctity. According to the legend, the
primitive Budubudukala who first adorned the face of the earth was a
belated product of the world&rsquo;s creation. When he was born or
rather evolved, the rest of mankind was already in the field,
struggling for existence. Practically the whole scheme was complete,
and, in the economy of the universe, the Budubudukala found himself one
too many. In this quandary, he appealed to his goddess mother Amba
Bhavani, who took pity on him, and presented him with her husband the
god Parameswara&rsquo;s drum with the blessing &lsquo;My son, there is
nothing else for you but this. Take it and beg, and you will
prosper.&rsquo; Among beggars, the Budubudukala has constituted himself
a superior mendicant, to whom the handful of rice usually doled out is
not acceptable. His demand is for clothes of any description, good, bad
or indifferent, new or old, torn or whole. For, in the plenitude of his
wisdom, he has realised that a cloth is a marketable commodity, which,
when exchanged for money, fetches more than the handful of rice. The
Budubudukala is continually on the tramp, and regulates his movements
according to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282"
name="pb282">282</a>]</span>seasons of the year. As a rule, he pays his
visit to the rural parts after the harvest is gathered, for it is then
that the villagers are at their best, and in a position to handsomely
remunerate him for his pains. But, in whatever corner of the province
he may be, as the Dusserah<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4532src" href=
"#xd26e4532" name="xd26e4532src">11</a> approaches, he turns his face
towards Vellore in North Arcot, where the annual festival in honour of
Amba Bhavani is celebrated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4538src"

<p>The principal tribal deity of the Kuruvikk&#257;ran beggars is
K&#257;li or Durga, and each sept possesses a small metal plate with a
figure of the goddess engraved on it, which is usually kept in the
custody of the headman. It is, however, sometimes pledged, and
money-lenders give considerable sums on the security of the idol, as
the Kuruvikk&#257;rans would on no account fail to redeem it. At the
annual festival of the goddess, while some cakes are being cooked in
oil, a member of the tribe prays that the goddess will descend on him.
Taking some of the cakes out of the boiling oil, he rubs the oil on his
head with his palm. He is then questioned by those assembled, to whom
he gives oracular replies, after sucking the blood from the cut throat
of a goat.</p>
<p>The nomad Koravas or Yerukalas earn a livelihood partly by telling
fortunes. The Telugu name Yerukala is said to mean fortune-teller, and,
as the women go on their rounds through the streets, they call out
&ldquo;Yeruko, amma, yeruku&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, prophecies, mother,
prophecies.</p>

<p>Concerning the Pachaikutti (tattooer) or Gadde (soothsayer) section
of these people, Mr Paupa Rao Naidu writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4559src" href="#xd26e4559" name="xd26e4559src">13</a> that
&ldquo;the woman proceeds with a basket and a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>winnowing tray to a village, proclaiming their
ostensible profession of tattooing and soothsaying, which they do for
grain or money. When unfortunate village women, who always lose their
children or often fall ill, see these Gadde women moving about, they
call them into their houses, make them sit, and, pouring some grain
into their baskets, ask them about their past misery and future lot.
These women, who are sufficiently trained to speak in suitable
language, are clever enough to give out some yarns in equivocal terms,
so that the anxious women, who hope for better futurity, understand
them in the light uppermost in their own minds. The Korava women will
be duly rewarded, and doubly too, for they never fail to study the
nature of the house, to see if it offers a fair field for booty for
their men.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4564src" href="#xd26e4564"
name="xd26e4564src">14</a></p>
<p>It is said that Korava women invoke the village goddesses when they
are telling fortunes. They use a winnowing fan and grains of rice in
doing this, and prophecy good or evil according to the number of grains
on the fan.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4569src" href="#xd26e4569" name=
"xd26e4569src">15</a> They carry a basket, winnow, stick, and a wicker
tray in which cowry shells are embedded in a mixture of cow-dung and
turmeric. The basket represents the goddess Kolapuriamma, and the
cowries P&#333;l&#275;ramma. When telling fortunes, the woman places on
the basket the winnow, rice, betel leaves and areca nuts, and the
wicker tray. Holding her client&rsquo;s hand over the winnow, and
moving it about, she commences to chant, and name all sorts of deities.
From time to time, she touches the hand of the person whose fortune is
being told with the stick. The Korava women are very clever at
extracting information concerning the affairs of a client, before they
proceed to tell her fortune. In a note on the initiation of Yerukala
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>girls into the profession of fortune-telling in
Vizagapatam, Mr Hayavadana Rao writes that it is carried out on a
Sunday succeeding the first puberty ceremony. A caste feast, with
plenty of strong drink, is held, but the girl herself fasts. The feast
over, she is taken to a spot at a little distance from the settlement,
called Yerukonda. This is said to be the name of a place on the trunk
road between Vizianagram and Chicacole, to which girls were taken in
former days to be initiated. The girl is blindfolded with a cloth.
Boiled rice and green gram (grain) are mixed with the blood of a black
fowl, black pig, and black goat, which are killed. Of this mixture she
must take at least three morsels, and, if she does not vomit, it is
taken as a sign that she will become a good fortune-teller. Vomiting
would indicate that she would be a false prophetess.</p>
<p>The Irulas of the Tamil country, like the Yerukalas, are
professional fortune-tellers. The Yerukala will carry out the work
connected with her profession anywhere, at any time, and any number of
times in a day. The Irula, on the contrary, remains at his home, and
will only tell fortunes close to his hut, or near the hut where his
gods are kept. In case of sickness, people of all classes come to
consult the Irula fortune-teller, whose occupation is known as Kannimar
varnithal. Taking up his drum, he warms it over the fire, or exposes it
to the heat of the sun. When it is sufficiently dry to vibrate to his
satisfaction, Kannimar is worshipped by breaking a cocoanut, and
burning camphor and incense. Closing his eyes, the Irula beats the
drum, and shakes his head about, while his wife, who stands near him,
sprinkles turmeric water over him. After a few minutes, bells are tied
to his right wrist. In about a quarter of an hour he begins to shiver,
and breaks out in a profuse perspiration. This is a sure sign
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>that he is inspired by the goddess. The shaking
of his body becomes more violent, he breathes rapidly, and hisses like
a snake. Gradually he becomes calmer, and addresses those around him as
if he were the goddess, saying: &ldquo;Oh! children, I have come down
on my car, which is decorated with mango flowers, margosa, and jasmine.
You need fear nothing so long as I exist, and you worship me. This
country will be prosperous, and the people will continue to be happy.
Ere long my precious car, immersed in the tank (pond) on the hill, will
be taken out, and after that the country will become more
prosperous,&rdquo; and so on. Questions are generally put to the
inspired man, not directly, but through his wife. Occasionally, even
when no client has come to consult him, the Irula will take up his drum
towards dusk, and chant the praises of Kannimar, sometimes for hours at
a stretch, with a crowd of Irulas collected round him.</p>
<p>I gather, from a note by Mr. T. Ranga Rao, that the jungle
Y&#257;n&#257;dis of the Telugu country pose as prophets of human
destinies, and pretend to hold intercourse with gods and goddesses, and
to intercede between god and man. Every village or circle has one or
more soothsayers, who learn their art from experts under a rigid
routine. The period of pupilage is a fortnight spent in retreat, on a
dietary of milk and fruits. The god or goddess Venkat&#275;swaralu,
Subbaroyadu, Malakondroyadu, Ankamma, or P&#333;l&#275;ramma, appears
like a shadow, and inspires the pupil, who, directly the period of
probation has ceased, burns camphor and frankincense. He then sings in
praise of the deity, takes a sea-bath with his master, gives a
sumptuous feast, and becomes an independent soothsayer. The story runs
that the ardent soothsayers of old wrought miracles by stirring boiling
rice with his hand, which was proof against burn or hurt. His modern
brother invokes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286"
name="pb286">286</a>]</span>the gods with burning charcoal in his
folded hands, to the beat of a drum. People flock in large numbers to
learn the truth. The soothsayer arranges the tribal deity Chenchu
D&#275;vudu, and various local gods, in a god-house, which is always
kept scrupulously clean, and where worship is regularly carried on. The
auspicious days for soothsaying are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The
chief soothsayer is a male. The applicant presents him with areca nuts,
fruit, flowers, and money. The soothsayer bathes, and sits in front of
his house smeared with black, white, red, and other colours. His wife,
or some other female, kindles a fire, and throws frankincense into it.
He beats his drum and sings, while a woman within repeats the chant in
a shrill voice. The songs are in praise of the deity, at whose and the
soothsayer&rsquo;s feet the applicant prostrates himself, and invokes
their aid. The soothsayer feels inspired, and addresses the suppliant
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;You have neglected me. You do not worship me.
Propitiate me adequately, or ruin is yours.&rdquo; The future is
predicted in song, and the rural folk place great faith in the
predictions.</p>
<p>As an example of devil worship and divination, the practice thereof
by the Tamil Valaiyans and Kallans of Orattan&#257;du in the Tanjore
district is described as follows by Mr F. R. Hemingway.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4584src" href="#xd26e4584" name=
"xd26e4584src">16</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Valaiyan houses generally have an odiyan
(<i>Odina Wodier</i>) tree in the backyard, wherein the devils are
believed to live, and, among the Kallans, every street has a tree for
their accommodation. They are propitiated at least once a year, the
more virulent under the tree itself, and the rest in the house,
generally on a Friday or Monday. Kallans attach importance to Friday in
&#256;di (July and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287"
name="pb287">287</a>]</span>August), the cattle Pongal day in Tai
(January and February), and Kartigai day in the month Kartigai
(November and December). A man, with his mouth covered with a cloth to
indicate silence and purity, cooks rice in the backyard, and pours it
out in front of the tree, mixed with milk and jaggery (crude sugar).
Cocoanuts and toddy are also placed there. These are offered to the
devils, represented in the form of bricks or mud images placed at the
foot of the tree, and camphor is set alight. A sheep is then brought
and slaughtered, and the devils are supposed to spring one after
another from the tree into one of the bystanders. This man then becomes
filled with the divine afflatus, works himself up into a kind of
frenzy, becomes the mouthpiece of the spirits, pronounces their
satisfaction or the reverse at the offerings, and gives utterance to
cryptic phrases, which are held to foretell good or evil fortune to
those in answer to whom they are made. When all the devils in turn have
spoken and vanished, the man recovers his senses. The devils are
worshipped in the same way in the house, except that no blood is
shed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following example of the conviction of a thief by a diviner is
recorded by Mrs Murray-Aynsley.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4598src"
href="#xd26e4598" name="xd26e4598src">17</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A friend&rsquo;s ayah had her blanket stolen.
The native woman rejected the interference of the police, which her
mistress proposed, but said she would send for one of her own diviners.
He came, caused a fire to be lighted in an earthen vessel, then took a
small basket-work grain-sifter used for winnowing rice. Having repeated
certain prayers or incantations, the diviner stuck a pair of scissors
into the deepest part of this tray, and, having done this, required the
two assistants he brought with him each to put a finger beneath the
holes in the scissors, and then hold the sifter suspended over the
fire. The servants of the house were then all required, each in turn,
to take a small quantity of uncooked rice in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>hands, and drop it into the flame, between the
fork formed by the scissors, the diviner all the time repeating some
formula. All went very smoothly till the woman-servant, whom my friend
had all along suspected of the theft, performed this ceremony, on which
the grain-sifter commenced turning round rapidly. The culprit was
convicted, and confessed the theft.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following method of discovering theft by chewing rice is
described by Daniel Johnson.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4610src" href=
"#xd26e4610" name="xd26e4610src">18</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A Br&#257;hmin is sent for, who writes down all
the names of the people in the house, who are suspected. Next day he
consecrates a piece of ground by covering it with cow-dung and water,
over which he says a long prayer. The people then assemble on this spot
in a line facing the Br&#257;hmin, who has with him some dry rice, of
which he delivers to each person the weight of a four-cornered rupee,
or that quantity weighed with the sacred stone called Salagram, which
is deposited in a leaf of the pippal or banyan tree. At the time of
delivering it, the Br&#257;hmin puts his right hand on each
person&rsquo;s head, and repeats a short prayer; and, when finished, he
directs them all to chew the rice, which at a given time must be
produced on the leaves masticated. The person or persons, whose rice is
not thoroughly masticated, or exhibits any blood on it, is considered
guilty. The faith they all have of the power of the Bra&#817;hmin, and
a guilty conscience operating at the same time, suppresses the natural
flow of saliva to the mouth, without which the hard particles of the
rice bruise and cut the gums, causing them to bleed, which they
themselves are sensible of, and in most instances confess the
crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">For the following note<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4625src" href="#xd26e4625" name="xd26e4625src">1</a> on
agricultural ceremonies in Malabar, I am indebted to Mr C. Karunakara
Menon, who writes as an eye-witness thereof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Vishu, the feast of the vernal equinox, is
celebrated on the first of the Malabar month M&#275;dom, between the
10th and 14th of April. To the Tamulians it is the New Year&rsquo;s
day, but to the people of Malabar it marks the commencement of the new
agricultural year. A Malabar proverb says &lsquo;No hot weather after
Vishu.&rsquo; The first thing seen on the morning of Vishu day is
considered as an omen for the whole year. Every Malay&#257;li takes
care, therefore, to look at an auspicious object. Arrangements are
accordingly made to have a kani, which means a sight or spectacle
(<i>see</i> p. 18). After the first sight, the elders make presents of
money to the junior members of the family and the servants. After the
distribution of money, the most important function on Vishu morning is
the laying of the spade-furrow, as a sign that cultivation operations
have commenced. A spade decorated with konna (<i>Cassia Fistula</i>)
flowers, is brought, and a portion of the yard on the north side
smeared with cow-dung, and painted with powdered rice-water. An
offering is made on the spot to Ganapathi (the elephant god), and a
member of the family, turning to the east, cuts the earth three times.
A ceremony on a grander scale is called the Ch&#257;l, which literally
means <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>a furrow, for an account of which we must begin
with the visit of the astrologer (Kanisan) on Vishu eve. Every
d&#275;sam (hamlet) in Malabar has its own astrologer, who visits
families under his jurisdiction on festive occasions (<i>see</i> p.
275). Accordingly, on the eve of the new agricultural year, every Hindu
home in the district is visited by the Kanisans of the respective
d&#275;sams, who, for a modest present of rice, vegetables, and oils,
make a forecast of the season&rsquo;s prospects, which is engrossed on
a cadjan (palm leaf). This is called the Vishu phalam, which is
obtained by comparing the nativity with the equinox. Special mention is
made therein as to the probable rainfall from the position of the
planets&mdash;highly prized information in a district where there are
no irrigation works or large reservoirs for water. But the most
important item in the forecast is the day and time at which the first
ploughing is to take place. The Ch&#257;l is one of the most impressive
and solemn of the Malabar agricultural ceremonies, and, in its most
orthodox form, is now prevalent only in the Palgh&#257;t t&#257;luk. At
the auspicious hour shown in the forecast, the master of the house, the
cultivation agent, and the Cherumars,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4645src" href="#xd26e4645" name="xd26e4645src">2</a> assemble in
the barn. A portion of the yard in front of the building is painted
with rice-water, and a lighted bell-metal lamp is placed near at hand
with some paddy (unhusked rice) and rice, and several cups made of the
leaves of the kanniram (<i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>)&mdash;as many cups
as there are varieties of seed in the barn. Then, placing implicit
faith in his gods and ancestors, the master of the house opens the
barn-door, followed by a Cheruman with a new painted basket containing
the leaf cups. The master then takes a handful of seed from a
seed-basket, and fills one of the cups, and the cultivating agent, head
Cheruman, and others who are interested in a good harvest, fill the
cups till the seeds are exhausted. The basket, with the cups, is next
taken to the decorated portion of the yard. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>A
new ploughshare is fastened to a new plough, and a pair of cattle are
brought onto the scene. Plough, cattle, and basket, are all painted
with rice-water. A procession proceeds to the fields, on reaching which
the head Cheruman lays down the basket, and makes a mound of earth with
the spade. To this a little manure is added, and the master throws a
handful of seed into it. The cattle are then yoked, and one turn is
ploughed by the head Cheruman. Inside this at least seven furrows are
made, and the plough is dropped to the right. An offering is made to
Ganapathi, and the master throws some seed into the furrow. Next the
head Cheruman calls out, &lsquo;May the gods on high, and the deceased
ancestors, bless the seed which has been thrown broadcast, and the
cattle which are let loose, the mother and children of the house, the
master and the slaves. May they also vouchsafe to us a good crop, good
sunshine, and a good harvest.&rsquo; A cocoanut is then cut on the
ploughshare, and from the cut portions several deductions are made. If
the hinder portion is larger than the front one, it augurs an excellent
harvest. If the nut is cut into two equal portions, the harvest will be
moderate. If the cut passes through the eyes of the nut, or if no water
is left in the cut portions, certain misfortune is foreboded. The cut
fragments are then taken with a little water inside them, and a leaf of
the tulsi plant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4654src" href="#xd26e4654"
name="xd26e4654src">3</a> (sacred basil, <i>Ocimum sanctum</i>) dropped
in. If the leaf turns to the right, a propitious harvest is assured,
whereas, if it turns to the left, certain calamity will follow. This
ceremonial concluded, there is much shouting, and the names of all the
gods are called out in a confused prayer. The party then breaks up, and
the unused seeds are divided among the workmen. The actual sowing of
the seed takes place towards the middle of May. The local deity who is
responsible for good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292"
name="pb292">292</a>]</span>crops is Cherukunnath Bhagavathi, who is
also called Annap&#363;rana, and is worshipped in the Chirakkal
t&#257;luk. Before the seed is sown, a small quantity is set apart as
an offering to the goddess Annapurna Iswari. By July the crops should
be ready for harvesting, and the previous year&rsquo;s stock is running
low. Accordingly, several ceremonies are crowded into the month
Karkitakam (July-August). When the sun passes from the sign of Gemini
to Cancer, <i>i.e.</i>, on the last day of Mithuna (June-July), a
ceremony called the driving away of Potti (evil spirit) is performed in
the evening. The house is cleaned, and the rubbish collected in an old
winnowing basket. A woman rubs oil on her head, and, taking the basket,
goes three times round the house, while children run after her, calling
out, &lsquo;Potti, phoo&rsquo; (run away, evil spirit). On the
following morning the good spirit is invoked, and asked to bless every
householder, and give a good harvest. Before dawn a handful of veli, a
wild yam (<i>Caladium nymph&oelig;iflorum</i>), and turmeric, together
with ten herbs called dasapushpam (ten flowers), such as are worn in
the head by Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hman ladies after the morning bath,
are brought in. They are:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Thiruth&#257;li (<i>Ipom&oelig;a sepiaria</i>).</li>
<li>Nilappana (<i>Curculigo orchioides</i>).</li>
<li>Karuka (<i>Cynodon Dactylon</i>).</li>
<li>Cherupoola (<i>&AElig;rua lanata</i>).</li>
<li>Muyalchevi (<i>Emelia sonchifolia</i>).</li>
<li>Puvamkurunthala (<i>Vernonia cinerea</i>).</li>
<li>Ulinna (<i>Cardiospermum Halicacabum</i>).</li>
<li>Mukutti (<i>Biophytum sensitivum</i>).</li>
<li>Kannunni (<i>Eclipta alba</i>).</li>
<li>Krishnakananthi (<i>Evolvulus alsinoides</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Each of the above is believed to be the special favourite of
some deity, <i>e.g.</i>, Nilappana of the god of riches,
Thiruth&#257;li of the wife of K&#257;ma, the god of love, etc. They
are stuck in the front eaves of every house with some cow-dung. Then,
before daybreak, Sri Bhagavathi is formally installed, and her
symbolical presence is continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>daily till the end of the
month Karkitakam. A plank, such as is used by Malay&#257;lis when they
sit at meals, is well washed, and smeared with ashes. On it are placed
a mirror, a potful of ointment made of sandal, camphor, musk, and
saffron (turmeric), a small round box containing red paint, a goblet
full of water, and a gr&#257;ndham (sacred book made of cadjan),
usually D&#275;vi-Mah&#257;thmyam, <i>i.e.</i>, song in praise of
Bhagavathi. By its side the ten flowers are set. On the first day of
Karkitakam, in some places, an attempt is made to convert the malignant
K&#257;li into a benificent deity. From Calicut northward, this
ceremonial is celebrated, for the most part by children, on a grand
scale. From early morning they may be seen collecting ribs of plantain
(banana) leaves, with which they make representations of a ladder,
cattle-shed, plough, and yoke. Representations of cattle are made from
the leaves of the jak tree (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>). These are
placed in an old winnowing basket. The materials for a feast are placed
in a pot, and the toy agricultural articles and the pot are carried
round each house three times, while the children call out
&lsquo;K&#257;lia, K&#257;lia, monster, monster, receive our offering,
and give us plenty of seed and wages, protect our cattle, and support
our fences.&rsquo; The various articles are then placed under a jak
tree, on the eastern side of the house if possible. The next important
ceremony is called the Nira, or bringing in of the first-fruits. It is
celebrated about the middle of Karkitakam. The house is cleaned, and
the doors and windows are cleansed with the rough leaves of a tree
called p&#257;rakam (<i>Ficus hispida</i>), and decorated with white
rice paint. The walls are whitewashed, and the yard is smeared with
cow-dung. The ten flowers (dasapushpam) are brought to the gate of the
house, together with leaves of the following:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Athi (<i>Ficus glomerata</i>).</li>
<li>Ithi (<i>Ficus infectoria</i>).</li>
<li>Aray&#257;l (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>).</li>
<li>P&#275;ral (<i>Ficus bengalensis</i>).</li>
<li>Illi (tender leaves of bamboo).</li>
<li>Nelli (<i>Phyllanthus Emblica</i>).</li>
<li>Jak (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>).</li>
<li>Mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;On the morning of the ceremony, the priest of the local
temple comes out therefrom, preceded by a man blowing a conch
(<i>Turbinella rapa</i>) shell.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4783src"
href="#xd26e4783" name="xd26e4783src">4</a> This is a signal for the
whole village, and every household sends out a male member, duly
purified by a bath and copiously smeared with sacred ashes, to the
fields, to gather some ears of paddy. Sometimes the paddy is brought
from the temple, instead of the field. It is not necessary to pluck the
paddy from one&rsquo;s own fields. Free permission is given to pluck it
from any field in which it may be ripe. When the paddy is brought near
the house, the above said leaves are taken out from the gate-house,
where they had been kept over night, and the ears of paddy are laid
thereon. The bearer is met at the gate by a woman of the house with a
lighted lamp. The new paddy is then carried to the house in procession,
those assembled crying out &lsquo;Fill, fill; increase, increase; fill
the house; fill the baskets; fill the stomachs of the children.&rsquo;
In a portion of the verandah, which is decorated with rice paint, a
small plank, with a plantain leaf on it, is set. Round this the man who
bears the paddy goes three times, and, turning due east, places it on
the leaf. On the right is set the lighted lamp. An offering of
cocoanuts and sweets is made to Ganapathi, and the leaves and ears of
paddy are attached to various parts of the house, the agricultural
implements, and even to trees. A sumptuous repast brings the ceremony
to a close. At Palgh&#257;t, when the new paddy is carried in
procession, the people say &lsquo;Fill like the Kott&#257;ram in
Kozhalmannam; fill like the expansive sands of the Perar.&rsquo; This
Kott&#257;ram is eight miles west of Palgh&#257;t. According to Dr
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4786" title=
"Source: Gundest">Gundert</span>, the word means a store-house, or
place where temple affairs are managed. It is a ruined building with
crumbling walls, lined inside with laterite, and outside with slabs of
granite. It was the granary of the Maruth&#363;r temple adjoining it,
and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>the story goes that the supply in this granary
was inexhaustible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next ceremony of importance is called Puthari (meal of
new rice). In some places it takes place on Nira day, but, as a rule,
it is an independent festival, which takes place during the great
national festival &#332;nam in August. When the new rice crop has been
threshed, a day is fixed for the ceremony. Those who have no land under
cultivation simply add some grains of the new rice to their meal. An
indispensable curry on this day is made of the leaves of <i>Cassia
Tora</i>, peas, the fruit of puthari chundanga (<i>Swertia
Chirata</i>), brinjals (<i>Solanum Melongena</i>), and green pumpkins.
The first crop is now harvested. There are no special ceremonies
connected with the cultivation of the second crop, except the one
called Ch&#275;ttotakam in the month of Thulam (November), which is
observed in the Palgh&#257;t t&#257;luk. It is an offering made to the
gods, when the transplantation is completed; to wipe out the sin the
labourers may have committed by unwittingly killing the insects and
reptiles concealed in the earth. The god, whose protection is invoked
on this occasion, is called Muni. No barn is complete without its own
Muni, who is generally represented by a block of granite beneath a
tree. He is the protector of cattle and field labourers, and arrack
(liquor), toddy, and blood, form necessary ingredients for his
worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In well-to-do families, a goat is sacrificed to him, but the
poorer classes satisfy him with the blood of a fowl. The officiating
priest is generally the cultivation agent, who is a N&#257;yar, or
sometimes a Cheruman. The goat or fowl is brought before the god, and a
mixture of turmeric and chunam (lime) sprinkled over it. If the animal
shakes, it is a sign that the god is satisfied. If it does not, the
difficulty is got over by a very liberal interpretation of the smallest
movement of the animal, and a further application of the mixture. The
god who ensures sunshine and good weather is Mullan. He is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>a
rural deity, and is set up on the borders and ridges of the
rice-fields. Like Muni, he is propitiated by the sacrifice of a fowl.
The second crop is harvested in Makaram (end of January), and a
festival called Uch&#257;ral is observed from the twenty-eighth to the
thirtieth in honour of the menstruation of mother earth, which is
believed to take place on those days, which are observed as days of
abstinence from all work, except hunting. A complete holiday is given
to the Cherumans. The first day is called the closing of uch&#257;ral.
Towards evening some thorns, five or six broomsticks, and ashes, are
taken to the room in which the grain is stored. The door is closed, and
the thorns and sticks are placed against it, or fixed to it with
cow-dung. The ashes are spread before it, and, during that and the
following day, no one will open the door. On the second day, cessation
from work is scrupulously observed. The house may not be cleaned, and
the daily smearing of the floor with cow-dung is avoided. Even gardens
may not be watered. On the fourth day the uch&#257;ral is opened, and a
basketful of dry leaves is taken to the fields, and burnt with a little
manure. The <span class="corr" id="xd26e4806" title=
"Source: Uch&#257;ra">Uch&#257;ral</span> days are the quarter days of
Malabar, and demands for surrender of property may be made only on the
day following the festival, when all agricultural leases expire. By the
burning of leaves and manure on his estate, the cultivator, it seems to
me, proclaims that he remains in possession of the property. In support
of this, we have the practice of a new lessee asking the lessor whether
any other person has burnt dry leaves in the field. The Uch&#257;ral
festival is also held at Cherupulcherri, and at Kanayam near Shoranur.
Large crowds assemble with representations of cattle in straw, which
are taken in procession to the temple of Bhagavathi with beating of
drums and the shouting of the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the Cherumans, who are agrestic serfs, play a leading
part in some of the festivals which have just been described, is
significant. In an interesting note <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>on the privileges of
the servile classes, Mr M. J. Walhouse writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4814src" href="#xd26e4814" name="xd26e4814src">5</a> that
&ldquo;it is well known that the servile castes in Southern India once
held far higher positions, and were indeed masters of the land on the
arrival of the Br&#257;hmanical race. Many curious vestiges of their
ancient power still survive in the shape of certain privileges, which
are jealously cherished, and, their origin being forgotten, are much
misunderstood. These privileges are remarkable instances of survivals
from an extinct state of society&mdash;shadows of long-departed
supremacy, bearing witness to a period when the present haughty
high-caste races were suppliants before the ancestors of degraded
classes, whose touch is now regarded as pollution. In the great
festival of Siva at Trival&#363;r in Tanjore, the headman of the
Par&#275;yans is mounted on the elephant with the god, and carries his
chauri (yak-tail fly fan). In Madras, at the annual festival of the
goddess of the Black Town (now George Town<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4817src" href="#xd26e4817" name="xd26e4817src">6</a>), when a
t&#257;li (marriage badge) is tied round the neck of the idol in the
name of the entire community, a Par&#275;yan is chosen to represent the
bridegroom. At M&#275;lkote in Mysore, the chief seat of the followers
of R&#257;m&#257;nuja Ach&#257;rya, and at the Br&#257;hman temple at
B&#275;lur, the Holeyas or Par&#275;yans have the right of entering the
temple on three days in the year, specially set apart for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The privilege is said to have been conferred on the Holeyas, in
return for their helping R&#257;m&#257;nuja to recover the image of
Krishna, which was carried off to Delhi by the Muhammadans. Paraiyans
are allowed to take part in pulling the cars of the idols in the great
festivals at Conjeeveram, Kumbak&#333;nam, and
Sr&#299;villiputt&#363;r. Their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>touch is not reckoned to
defile the ropes used, so that other Hindus will pull with them. It was
noted by Mr F. H. Ellis, who was Collector of the Madras district in
1812, that &ldquo;a custom prevails among the slave castes in
Tondeimandalam, especially in the neighbourhood of Madras, which may be
considered as a periodical assertion of independence at the close of
the Tamil month Auni, with which the revenue year ends, and the
cultivation of the ensuing year ought to commence. The whole of the
slaves strike work, collect in bodies outside of the villages, and so
remain until their masters, by promising to continue their privileges,
by solicitations, presents of betel, and other gentle means, induce
them to return. The slaves on these occasions, however well treated
they may have been, complain of various grievances, real and imaginary,
and threaten a general desertion. This threat, however, they never
carry into execution, but, after the usual time, everything having been
conducted according to m&#257;m&#363;l (custom), return quietly to
their labours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming to more recent times, it is recorded by Mr Walhouse<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4826src" href="#xd26e4826" name="xd26e4826src">7</a>
that &ldquo;at particular seasons there is a festival much resembling
the classic Saturnalia, in which, for the time, the relation of slaves
and masters is inverted, and the former attack the latter with
unstinted satire and abuse, and threaten to strike work unless
confirmed in their privileges, and humbly solicit to return to
labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In villages in South Canara there are certain r&#257;kshasas
(demons), called Kambla Asura, who preside over the fields. To
propitiate them, buffalo races,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4833src"
href="#xd26e4833" name="xd26e4833src">8</a> which are an exciting form
of sport, are held, usually in October and November, before the second
or sugge crop is sown. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>is believed that, if the races are
omitted, there will be a failure of the crop. The Koragas (field
labourers) sit up through the night before the Kambla day, performing a
ceremony called panikkuluni, or sitting under the dew. They sing songs
to the accompaniment of a band about their devil N&#299;cha, and offer
toddy and a rice pudding boiled in a large earthen pot, which is broken
so that the pudding remains as a solid mass. This pudding is called
kand&#275;l add&#275;, or pot pudding. On the morning of the races, the
Holeyas (agrestic serfs) scatter manure over the field, in which the
races are to take place, and plough it. On the following day, the
seedlings are planted. To propitiate various demons, the days following
the races are devoted to cock-fighting, in which hundreds of birds may
take part.</p>
<p>Important agricultural ceremonies are performed by the Badagas of
the N&#299;lgiris, who carry out most of the cultivation on these
hills, at the time of sowing and harvesting the crop. The seed-sowing
ceremony takes place in March, and, in some places, a Kurumba (jungle
tribesman) plays an important part in it. On an auspicious day&mdash;a
Tuesday before the crescent moon&mdash;a priest of the Devv&#275;
temple sets out several hours before dawn with five or seven kinds of
grain in a basket and a sickle, accompanied by a Kurumba, and leading a
pair of bullocks with a plough. On reaching the field selected, the
priest pours the grain into the cloth of the Kurumba, and, yoking the
animals to the plough, makes three furrows in the soil. The Kurumba,
stopping the bullocks, kneels on the ground between the furrows, facing
east. Removing his turban, he places it on the ground, and, closing his
ears with his palms, bawls out &ldquo;Dho, Dho&rdquo; thrice. He then
rises, and scatters the grain thrice on the soil. The priest and
Kurumba then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>return to the village, and the former deposits
what remains of the grain in the store-room. A new pot, full of water,
is placed in the milk-house, and the priest dips his right hand
therein, saying &ldquo;Nerathubitta&rdquo; (it is full). This ceremony
is an important one, as, until it has been performed, sowing may not
commence. It is a day of feasting, and, in addition to rice,
<i>Dolichos Lablab</i> is cooked.</p>
<p>Another agricultural ceremony of the Badagas is called Devva habba
or tenai (<i>Setaria italica</i>), and is usually celebrated in June or
July, always on a Monday. It is apparently performed in honour of the
gods Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi and Hiriya Udaya, to whom a group of
villages will have temples dedicated. The festival is celebrated at one
place, whither the Badagas from other villages proceed, to take part in
it. About midday, some Badagas and the temple priest go from the temple
of Hiriya Udaya to that of Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi. The procession is
usually headed by a Kurumba, who scatters fragments of t&#363;d
(<i>Meliosma pungens</i>) bark and wood as he goes on his way. The
priest takes with him the materials necessary for performing worship,
and, after worshipping Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi, the party return to
the Hiriya Udaya temple, where milk and cooked rice are offered to the
various gods within the temple precincts. On the following day, all
assemble at the temple, and a Kurumba brings a few sheaves of
<i>Setaria italica</i>, and ties them to a stone set up at the main
entrance. After this, worship is done, and the people offer cocoanuts
to the god. Later on, all the women of the Madhave sept, who have given
birth to a first-born child, come, dressed up in holiday attire, with
their babies, to the temple. On this day they wear a special nose
ornament called elemukkuththi, which is only worn on one other
occasion, at the funeral of a husband. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>The women worship
Hiriya Udaya, and the priest gives them a small quantity of rice on
m&#299;nige (<i>Argyreia</i>) leaves. After eating this, they wash
their hands with water given to them by the priest, and leave the
temple in a line. As soon as the Devv&#275; festival is concluded, the
reaping of the crop commences, and a measure or two of grain gathered
on the first day is set apart for the Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi
temple.</p>
<p>By the Kotas (artisans and cultivators) of the N&#299;lgiris, a
seed-sowing ceremony is celebrated in the month of Kumbam
(February-March) on a Tuesday or Friday. For eight days the officiating
priest abstains from meat, and lives on vegetable diet, and may not
communicate directly with his wife for fear of pollution, a boy acting
as spokesman. On the Sunday before the ceremony, a number of cows are
penned in a kraal, and milked by the priest. The milk is preserved,
and, if the omens are favourable, is said not to turn sour. If it does,
this is attributed to the priest being under pollution from some cause
or other. On the day of the ceremony, the priest bathes in a stream,
and proceeds, accompanied by a boy, to a field or the forest. After
worshipping the gods, he makes a small seed-pan in the ground, and sows
therein a small quantity of r&#257;gi (<i>Eleusine Coracana</i>).
Meanwhile, the Kotas of the village go to the temple, and clean it.
Thither the priest and the boy proceed, and the deity is worshipped
with offerings of cocoanuts; betel, flowers, etc. Sometimes a
Terk&#257;ran (priest) becomes inspired, and gives expression to
oracular utterances. From the temple all go to the house of the priest,
who gives them a small quantity of milk and food. Three months later,
on an auspicious day, the reaping of the crop is commenced with a very
similar ceremonial. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302"
name="pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<p>Writing in 1832, Mr Harkness states<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4872src" href="#xd26e4872" name="xd26e4872src">9</a> that, during
the seed-sowing ceremony, &ldquo;offerings are made at the temples,
and, on the day of the full-moon, after the whole have partaken of a
feast, the blacksmith, and the gold and silversmith, constructing
separately a forge and furnace within the temple, each makes something
in the way of his vocation, the blacksmith a chopper or axe, the
silversmith a ring or other kind of ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the ceremonial observances of the Koyis of the
God&#257;vari district, the Rev. J. Cain writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4878src" href="#xd26e4878" name="xd26e4878src">10</a> that
&ldquo;at present the Koyis around Dummagudem have very few festivals,
except one at the harvest of the zonna (<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>).
Formerly they had one not only for every grain crop, but one when the
ippa<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4884src" href="#xd26e4884" name=
"xd26e4884src">11</a> (<i>Bassia</i>) flowers were ready to be
gathered, another when the pumpkins were ripe, at the first tapping of
the palm-tree for toddy, etc. Now, at the time the zonna crop is ripe
and ready to be cut, they take a fowl into the field, kill it, and
sprinkle its blood on any ordinary stone put up for the occasion, after
which they are at liberty to partake of the new crop. In many villages
they would refuse to eat with any Koi who has neglected this ceremony,
to which they give the name Kottalu, which word is evidently derived
from the Telugu word kotta (new). Rice-straw cords are hung on trees,
to show that the feast has been observed. [In some places, Mr Hemingway
tells me, the victim is a sheep, and the first-fruits are offered to
the local gods and the ancestors.] Another singular feast occurs soon
after the ch&#333;lam (zonna) crop has been harvested. Early on the
morning of that day, all the men of each village have to turn out into
the forest to hunt, and woe betide the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>unlucky individual
who does not bring home some game, be it only a bird or a mouse. All
the women rush after him with cow-dung, mud, or dirt, and pelt him out
of their village, and he does not appear again in that village till
next morning. The hunter who has been most successful then parades the
village with his game, and receives presents of paddy (rice) from every
house. Mr Vanstavern, whilst boring for coal at Beddanolu, was visited
by all the Koi women of the village, dressed up in their lord&rsquo;s
clothes, and they told him that they had that morning driven their
husbands to the forest, to bring home game of some kind or
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr N. E. Marjoribanks once witnessed a grossly indecent pantomime,
held in connection with this festival, which is called
Bh&#363;d&#275;vi Panduga, or festival of the earth goddess. The
performers were women, of whom the drummers and sword-bearers were
dressed up as men. In a note on this festival, Mr F. R. Hemingway
writes that &ldquo;when the samalu crop is ripe, the Kois summon the
p&#363;j&#257;ri on a previously appointed day, and collect from every
house in the village a fowl and a handful of grain. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri has to fast all that night, and bathe early the next
morning. After bathing, he kills the fowls gathered the previous
evening in the names of the favourite gods, and fastens an ear of
samalu to each house, and then a feast follows. In the evening they
cook some of the new grain, and kill fresh fowls, which have not to be
curried but roasted, and the heart, liver, and lights of which are set
apart as the especial food of their ancestral spirits, and eaten by
every member of each household in their name. The bean feast is an
important one, as, until it is held, no one is allowed to gather any
beans. On the second day before the feast, the village p&#363;j&#257;ri
must eat only bread. The day before, he must fast for the whole
twenty-four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>hours, and, on the day of the feast, he must eat
only rice cooked in milk, with the bird offered in sacrifice. All the
men of the village accompany the p&#363;j&#257;ri to a neighbouring
tree, which must be a <i>Terminalia tomentosa</i>, and set up a stone,
which they thus dedicate to the goddess Kodalamma. Every one is bound
to bring for the p&#363;j&#257;ri a good hen and a seer of rice, and
for himself a cock and half a seer of rice. The p&#363;j&#257;ri also
demands from them two annas as his sacrificing fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seed-drills used by agriculturists in the Bellary district are
ornamented with carved representations of the sacred bull Nandi, the
monkey-god Hanum&#257;n, and the lingam, and decorated with margosa
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves, to bring good luck. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Rain-Making Ceremonies</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the Kaly&#257;na Singapu Kondhs of Vizagapatam,
a rain-making ceremony called barmar&#257;kshasi is performed, which
consists in making life-size mud images of women seated on the ground,
holding grindstones between their knees, and offering sacrifices to
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4913src" href="#xd26e4913" name=
"xd26e4913src">1</a></p>
<p>In times of drought, the Koyis of the God&#257;vari district hold a
festival to Bh&#299;ma, one of the P&#257;ndava brothers from whom they
claim descent, and, when rain falls, sacrifice a cow or a pig to him.
It is said<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4918src" href="#xd26e4918" name=
"xd26e4918src">2</a> to be considered very efficacious if the
Br&#257;hmans take in procession round the village an image of Varuna
(the god of rain) made of mud from the bed of a river or tank. Another
method is to pour a thousand pots of water over the lingam in the Siva
temple. M&#257;las (Telugu Pariahs) tie a live frog to a mortar, and
put on the top thereof a mud figure representing the deity
Gontiy&#257;lamma. They then take these objects in procession, singing
&ldquo;Mother frog, playing in water, pour rain by potsfull.&rdquo; The
villagers of other castes then come and pour water over the
M&#257;las.</p>
<p>The Rev. S. Nicholson informs me that, to produce rain in the Telugu
country, two boys capture a frog, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306"
href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>and put it into a basket with
some n&#299;m (margosa, <i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves. They tie the
basket to the middle of a stick, which they support on their shoulders.
In this manner, they make a circuit of the village, visiting every
house, singing the praises of the god of rain. The greater the noise
the captive animal makes, the better the omen, and the more gain for
the boys, for at every house they receive something in recognition of
their endeavours to bring rain upon the village fields.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In the Bellary district when the rain fails,
the K&#257;pu (Telugu cultivator) females catch a frog, and tie it
alive to a new winnowing fan made of bamboo. On this fan, leaving the
frog visible, they spread a few margosa leaves, and go singing from
door to door, &lsquo;Lady frog must have her bath; oh! rain god, give
at least a little water for her.&rsquo; This means that the drought has
reached such a stage that there is not even a drop of water for the
frogs. When the K&#257;pu female sings this song, the woman of the
house brings a little water in a vessel, pours it over the frog, which
is left on the fan outside the door sill, and gives some alms. She is
satisfied that such an action will bring down rain in torrents. On the
first full-moon day in the month of Bhadrapada (September), the
agricultural population in the Bellary district celebrate a festival
called Jokumara, to appease the rain-god. The Barike women (said to
belong to the Gaurimakkalu section of the Kabb&#275;ra caste) go round
the village in which they live, with a basket on their heads containing
margosa leaves, flowers of various kinds, and sacred ashes. They beg
for alms, especially from the cultivating classes, and, in return for
the alms bestowed (usually grain or food), they give some of the
leaves, flowers, and ashes. The cultivators take these to their fields,
prepare cholam (<i>Sorghum</i>) kanji or gruel, mix them with it, and
sprinkle the kanji over their fields. After this the cultivator
proceeds to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307"
name="pb307">307</a>]</span>potter&rsquo;s kiln in the village, and
fetches ashes from it, with which he makes the figure of a human being.
This figure is placed in a field, and called Jokumara or rain-god, and
is supposed to have the power of bringing down the rain in due season.
A second kind of Jokumara worship is called muddam, or the outlining of
rude representations of human figures with powdered charcoal. These are
made in the early morning, before the bustle of the day commences, on
the ground at cross-roads, and along thoroughfares. The Barikes, who
draw these figures, are paid a small remuneration in money or kind. The
figures represent Jokumara, who will bring down rain, when insulted by
people treading on him. Yet another kind of Jokumara worship prevails
in the Bellary district. When rain fails, the K&#257;pu females model a
small figure of a naked human being, which they place in a miniature
palanquin, and go from door to door, singing indecent songs, and
collecting alms. They continue this procession for three or four days,
and then abandon the figure in a field adjacent to the village. The
M&#257;las take possession of the abandoned Jokumara, and, in their
turn, go about singing indecent songs, and collecting alms for three or
four days, and then throw the figure away in some jungle. This form of
Jokumara worship is also believed to bring down plenty of rain. In the
Bellary district, the agriculturists have a curious superstition about
prophesying the state of the coming season. The village of Mailar
contains a Siva temple, which is famous throughout the district for an
annual festival held there in the month of February. This festival has
now dwindled into more or less a cattle fair. But the fame of the
temple continues as regards the Karanika, which is a cryptic sentence
uttered by the priest, containing a prophecy of the prospects of the
agricultural season. The puj&#257;ri (priest) of the temple is a Kuruba
(cultivating caste). The feast at the temple lasts for ten days. On the
last day, the god Siva is represented as returning victorious from the
battlefield, after having slain the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>demon Malla
(Mall&#257;sura) with a huge bow. He is met half-way from the field of
battle by the goddess. The wooden bow is placed on end before the god.
The Kuruba priest climbs up it, as it is held by two assistants, and
then gets on their shoulders. In this posture he stands rapt in silence
for a few minutes, looking in several directions. He then begins to
quake and quiver from head to foot. This is the sign of the spirit of
the god Siva possessing him. A solemn silence holds the assembly, for
the time of the Karanika has arrived. The shivering Kuruba utters a
cryptic sentence, such as &lsquo;Thunder struck the sky.&rsquo; This is
at once copied down, and interpreted as a prophecy that there will be
much rain in the year to come.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4938src" href="#xd26e4938" name="xd26e4938src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said that, in the year before the Mutiny, the prophecy was
&ldquo;They have risen against the white-ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The villagers at Kanuparti in the Guntur district of the Telugu
country objected, in 1906, to the removal of certain figures of the
sacred bull Nandi and lingams, which were scattered about the fields,
on the ground that the rainfall would cease, if these sacred objects
were taken away.</p>
<p>To bring down rain, Br&#257;hmans, and those non-Br&#257;hmans who
copy their ceremonial rites, have their Varuna japam, or prayers to
Varuna, the rain-god. Some of the lower classes, instead of addressing
their prayers to Varuna, try to induce a spirit or d&#275;vata named
Kodump&#257;vi (wicked one) to send her paramour Sukra to the affected
area. The belief seems to be that Sukra goes away to his concubinage
for about six months, and, if he does not then return, drought ensues.
The ceremony consists in making a huge figure of Kodump&#257;vi in
clay, which is placed on a cart, and dragged through the streets
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>for seven to ten days. On the last day, the
final death ceremonies of the figure are celebrated. It is disfigured,
especially in those parts which are usually concealed. Vettiyans
(Paraiyan grave-diggers), who have been shaved, accompany the figure,
and perform the funeral ceremonies. This procedure is believed to put
Kodump&#257;vi to shame, and to get her to induce Sukra to return, and
stay the drought. According to Mr W. Francis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4951src" href="#xd26e4951" name="xd26e4951src">4</a> the figure,
which is made of clay or straw, is dragged feet first through the
village by the Paraiyans, who accompany it, wailing as though they were
at a funeral, and beating drums in funeral time.</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr F. R. Hemingway that, when rain is wanted in the
Trichinopoly district, an effigy called Kom&#257;n (the king) is
dragged round the streets, and its funeral performed with great
attention to details. Or an effigy of Kodump&#257;vi is treated with
contumely. In some places, the women collect kanji (rice gruel) from
door to door, and drink it, or throw it away on a tank bund
(embankment), wailing the while as they do at funerals. People of the
higher castes repeat prayers to Varuna, and read portions of the
Vir&#257;ta Parvam in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, in the hope that the
land will be as fertile as the country of the Vir&#257;ts, where the
P&#257;ndavas lived. When the tanks and rivers threaten to breach their
banks, men stand naked on the bund, and beat drums; and, if too much
rain falls, naked men point firebrands at the sky. Their nudity is
supposed to shock the powers that bring the rain, and arrest their
further progress. According to Mr Francis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4956src" href="#xd26e4956" name="xd26e4956src">5</a> when too
much rain falls, the way to stop it is to send the eldest son to stand
in it stark naked, with a torch in his hand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>A Native of Coimbatore wrote a few years ago that we have done all
things possible to please the gods. We spent about two hundred rupees
in performing Varuna japam on a grand scale in a strictly orthodox
fashion. For a few days there were cold winds, and some lightning. But,
alas, the japam was over, and with that disappeared all signs of
getting any showers in the near future. It is noted by Haddon<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4963src" href="#xd26e4963" name="xd26e4963src">6</a>
that, in the Torres Straits, as elsewhere, the impossible is never
attempted, and a rain charm would not be made when there was no
expectation of rain coming, or during the wrong season.</p>
<p>There is, in some parts of the country, a belief that, if lepers are
buried when they die, rain will not visit the locality where their
corpses have been deposited. So they disinter the bodies, and throw the
remains thereof into the river, or burn them. Some years ago, a man who
was supposed to be a leper died, and was buried. His skeleton was
disinterred, put into a basket, and hung to a tree with a garland of
flowers round its neck. The Superintendent of Police, coming across it,
ordered it to be disposed of.</p>
<p>The following quaint superstitions relating to the origin of rain
are recorded by Mr Gopal Panikkar.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4971src"
href="#xd26e4971" name="xd26e4971src">7</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In the regions above the earth, there are
supposed to exist large monsters called Kalameghathanmar, to whom is
assigned the responsibility of supplying the earth with water. These
monsters are under the direction and control of Indra,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4977src" href="#xd26e4977" name="xd26e4977src">8</a>
and are possessed of enormous physical strength. They have two huge
horns projecting upwards from the sides of the crown of the head, large
flashing eyes, and other remarkable features. All the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>summer they are engaged in drawing up water from
the earth through their mouths, which they spit out to produce rain in
the rainy season. A still ruder imagination ascribes rain to the
periodical discharge of urine by these monsters. Hence, in some
quarters, there exists a peculiar aversion to the use of rain-water for
human consumption.&rdquo;</p>
